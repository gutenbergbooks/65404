<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Procopius was born at Cæsarea in Palestine, early in the
sixth or at the end of the fifth century. He made his
way, an adventurer, to Constantinople, where he began
as an advocate and Professor of Rhetoric. He had the
good fortune to be recommended to Belisarius, who appointed
him one of his secretaries. In that capacity
Procopius accompanied the general in his expedition to
the East, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 528, and in that against the Vandals,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 533. The successful prosecution of the war enriched
Belisarius to such an extent that he was enabled to maintain
a retinue of 7000 men, of whom Procopius seems to
have been one of the most trusted, since we find him
appointed Commissary General in the Italian war. On
his return to Constantinople, he was decorated with one
of the innumerable titles of the Byzantine Court, and
entered into the Senate. In the year 562 he was made
Prefect of Constantinople, and is supposed to have died
in 565—the same year as his former patron Belisarius.</p>

<p>His works are (1) the Histories (ἱστορίαι) in eight books,
namely, two on the Persian War (408-553), two on the
War with the Vandals (395-545), and four on the Wars
with the Goths, bringing the History down to the year 553.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv"> iv</span>
(2) The six books on the Buildings of Justinian, and (3) the
<i>Anecdota</i>, or Secret History—a work which has always
been attributed to him.</p>

<p>The ‘Histories’ appeared first in Latin, 1470, the translator
being Leonardo Bruni d’Arezzo (Leonardo Aretino),
who, believing his own MS. to be the only one in existence,
gave himself out for the author. They were first published
in Greek, at Augsburg, 1607: but the ‘Buildings’ had
already appeared at Basle, 1531.</p>

<p>The ‘Secret History’ was first published, with a translation
into Latin, at Lyons in 1623. The ‘Histories’ and the
‘Anecdota’ have been translated into French. An English
translation of the ‘Secret History’ was published in 1674.
No other part of Procopius has, until now, been translated.</p>

<p>The following version of the ‘De Ædificiis’ has been
specially made for the Pilgrims’ Text Society, by Aubrey
Stewart (late Fellow of Trinity, Cambridge), who has
added the valuable notes marked (S.). The notes marked
(L.), chiefly archæological, have been supplied by Professor
Hayter Lewis, and those marked (W.), chiefly
topographical, by Colonel Sir C. W. Wilson, the Director
of the Society.</p>

<p>The illustrations of St. Sophia are taken from the
magnificent work by Salzenberg, published at Berlin.</p>

<p>Those from Texier and Pullan are taken by the kind
permission of Mr. Pullan from their work on ‘Byzantine
Architecture.’</p>

<p>In the investigation of the antiquities of Palestine, the
name of Justinian, as associated with them, comes
forward as often as that of Constantine or Herod.</p>

<p>From Bethlehem to Damascus—from the sea-coast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v"> v</span>
far beyond the Jordan—there are few places of note in
which some remains, dating from his era, do not exist, or
in which, at the least, some records of his works are not
left in the history of his time. To him Mount Sinai owes
the Church of the Holy Virgin.</p>

<p>At Bethlehem he is said to have enlarged, if not
rebuilt, the great Basilica.</p>

<p>At Gerizim the mountain still bears on its summit the
remains of the church which he there constructed, and
Tiberias is still surrounded, in part, by the walls raised
by him.</p>

<p>He is known to have constructed a large church to the
Virgin on the Mount of Olives, and several other churches
in and about Jerusalem, the grandest of which is described
to have been an architectural gem, was in the Harem area
itself.</p>

<p>Besides these, which are definitely recorded to have
been his work, he is supposed by some of the best
authorities to have erected the Golden Gate and the
Double Gate; and of late years it has been contended that
the Sakhrah itself was constructed by him as it now exists.</p>

<p>But there is scarcely one of these edifices, where
remains of them exist or are supposed so to do, which has
not been the subject of controversy, the authorship of the
Sakhrah (taking that as an instance) having been assigned,
by various persons who would usually be considered as
authorities on the subject, to the Romans under Constantine,
to the Byzantines under Justinian, and to the
Arabs under Abd-el-Melek.</p>

<p>It becomes, therefore, important to have a clear record
as to what Justinian did, not only in Palestine but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi"> vi</span>
other countries, so as to be able to judge to some extent,
by well-authenticated examples, of the founders of those
edifices whose history is involved in doubt.</p>

<p>Of the writers who can give us this record, none has
such authority as Procopius, or gives so much detailed
information; and he has, for that reason, been largely
quoted by Gibbon and by well-nigh every other writer on
Byzantine history; and he gives such definite information
as to the dates of many of Justinian’s buildings which
remain to us, as to form a standard by which to recognise
the general characteristics in outline and detail adopted by
his architects in his greatest works, and which characterize
the style now well known as Byzantine.</p>

<p>Its first and greatest example is St. Sofia at Constantinople,
which is, perhaps, the boldest instance of a
sudden change in almost every respect, whether of plan,
elevation, or detail, which is known in architecture.</p>

<p>Before its construction, the ground-plan of well-nigh
every building known to Western architects had defined
the plan of all above it.</p>

<p>The columns in the apse of the Basilica, or church,
carried galleries or other erections above it, of varied
design, but in the same straight or curved lines as those
beneath them.</p>

<p>The lines of the dome (except in slightly exceptional
cases, such as the ruin known as the Temple of Minerva
Medica at Rome, or the Temple of the Winds at Athens)
were carried up on the distinct lines of the lower walls.</p>

<p>The capitals of the columns in the works of the ancient
Greeks or Romans were in each building carved on
the same design; and however beautiful each might be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii"> vii</span>
the eye would see but one form of the Doric, Ionic, or
Corinthian, through the whole range of a colonnade.</p>

<p>The Byzantines changed all that.</p>

<p>The great dome of St. Sophia (the boldest piece of
novel construction ever, perhaps, attempted) forms the
crown of a building quite original in plan; and this
dome is placed, not as that of the Roman Pantheon, low
down on thick walls of its own form, but suspended high
above all the roof around it, on four arches, which spring
from detached piers, the keystone alone of each arch
giving a direct support to the dome; in every other part
it overhangs the void in the boldest manner.</p>

<p>The circular work between these arches is carried in
a manner which is comparatively easy to imitate now;
but the rude and often picturesque results of attempts at
imitation in mediæval times, more especially in the South
of France, show how difficult the work was found to be at
the outset.</p>

<p>Earthquake and faults of construction occasioned the
rebuilding of the great dome; but it still crowns, after a
trial of more than 1,300 years, one of the most beautiful
buildings in existence.</p>

<p>Then the capitals of the columns, whose general outlines
bear few traces of the ancient orders, were often carved
each in a different manner, and, though harmonizing
with each other in general outline, could bear separate
scrutiny, and show each a special motive and design.</p>

<p>The carving of these capitals, and of the other beautiful
scroll-work and foliage which decorate the walls of
St. Sophia, has come down to us through the Normans,
and is quite peculiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii"> viii</span></p>

<p>It had none of the soft, round forms which the Romans
loved, but is cut in a sharp, crisp, and somewhat stiff style,
casting distinctly marked and sharp shadows, and the
eyes of the foliage and other well-marked parts are
emphasized by being deeply drilled in. Many of the
Byzantine characteristics had been, to a large extent,
foreshadowed in Eastern buildings, even at so early a
time as the Assyrian bas-reliefs; but it is to Byzantine
architects, under the fostering care of Justinian, that we
owe the picturesque changes and details of that style, the
Byzantine, which takes its name from his capital and is,
to a large extent, identified with himself.</p>

<p>All the drawings have been made for this volume by
Mr. George Armstrong, formerly on the Survey Party
under Captain Conder and Captain Kitchener.</p>

<p>I have not begun this work through any desire to make a
display of my own virtue, or trusting to my powers of
language, or wishing to gain credit by my knowledge of
the places described, for I had nothing to encourage
me to undertake so bold a project. But I have often
reflected on the great blessings which countries derive
from history, which transmits to posterity the remembrance
of our ancestors, and opposes the efforts of time to cover
them with oblivion; which always encourages virtue in
its readers by its praise, and deters them from vice by its
blame, and in this way destroys its power. All we need
study then is to make clear what has been done, and by
whom of mankind it was done; and this, I imagine, is
not impossible even for the weakest and feeblest writer;
besides this, the writing of history enables subjects who
have been kindly treated by their rulers, to express their
gratitude, and to make a more than adequate return,
seeing that they only for a time enjoy the goodness of
their princes, while they render their virtues immortal in
the memory of their descendants, many of whom in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2"> 2</span>
very way have been led by the glory of their ancestors to
a love of virtue, and have been probably preserved from
a dissolute course of life by the dread of disgrace. I
will shortly explain my object in making these prefatory
remarks.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justinian was born in our time,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
succeeding to the throne when the state was decayed,
added greatly to its extent and glory by driving out from
it the barbarians, who for so long a time had forced their
way into it, as I have briefly narrated in my ‘History
of the Wars.’ They say that Themistocles, the son of
Neocles, prided himself on his power of making a small
state great, but our Emperor has the power of adding
other states to his own, for he has annexed to the Roman
Empire many other states which at his accession were
independent, and has founded innumerable cities which
had no previous existence. As for religion, which he found
uncertain and torn by various heresies, he destroyed everything
which could lead to error, and securely established
the true faith upon one solid foundation. Moreover,
finding the laws obscure through their unnecessary multitude,
and confused by their conflict with one another, he
firmly established them by reducing the number of those
which were unnecessary, and in the case of those that
were contradictory, by confirming the better ones. He
forgave of his own accord those who plotted against him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3"> 3</span>
and, by loading with wealth those who were in want, and
relieving them from the misfortunes which had afflicted
them, he rendered the empire stable and its members
happy. By increasing his armies he strengthened the
Roman Empire, which lay everywhere exposed to the
attacks of barbarians, and fortified its entire frontier by
building strong places. Of his other acts the greater
part have been described by me in other works, but
his great achievements in building are set forth in this
book. We learn from tradition that Cyrus the Persian
was a great king, and the chief founder of the empire
of his countrymen; but whether he had any resemblance
to that Cyrus who is described by Xenophon the
Athenian in his Cyropædia, I have no means of telling, for
possibly the art of the writer has given some embellishments
to his achievements; while as for our present
Emperor Justinian (whom I think one may rightly call a
king by nature, since, as Homer says, he is as gentle as a
father), if one accurately considers his empire, one will
regard that of Cyrus as mere child’s play.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The proof of
this will be that the empire, as I just now said, has been
more than doubled by him, both in extent and in power;
whilst his royal clemency is proved by the fact that those
who wickedly plotted against his life, although they were
clearly convicted, not only are alive and in possession of
their property at the present day, but even command
Roman armies, and have been promoted to the consular
dignity. Now, as I said before, we must turn our attention
to the buildings of this monarch, lest posterity, beholding
the enormous size and number of them, should deny
their being the work of one man; for the works of many
men of former times, not being confirmed by history, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4"> 4</span>
been disbelieved through their own excessive greatness.
As is natural, the foundation of all my account will be the
buildings in Byzantium, for, as the old proverb has it, when
we begin a work we ought to put a brilliant frontispiece
to it.</p>

<p>I. The lowest dregs of the people in Byzantium once
assailed the Emperor Justinian in the rebellion called
Nika, which I have clearly described in my ‘History of
the Wars.’ To prove that it was not merely against the
Emperor, but no less against God that they took up
arms, they ventured to burn the church of the Christians.
(This church the people of Byzantium call Sophia, <i>i.e.</i>,
Σοφία—<i>Wisdom</i>; a name most worthy of God.) God
permitted them to effect this crime, knowing how great
the beauty of this church would be when restored. Thus
the church was entirely reduced to ashes; but the Emperor
Justinian not long afterwards adorned it in such a fashion,
that if anyone had asked the Christians in former times if
they wished their church to be destroyed and thus restored,
showing them the appearance of the church which we now
see, I think it probable that they would have prayed that
they might as soon as possible behold their church
destroyed, in order that it might be turned into its
present form. The Emperor, regardless of expense of all
kinds, pressed on its restoration, and collected together
all the workmen from every land, Anthemius of Tralles,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6"> 6</span>
by far the most celebrated architect, not only of his own
but of all former times, carried out the King’s zealous intentions,
organized the labours of the workmen, and prepared
models of the future construction. Associated with him was
another architect named Isidorus, a Milesian by birth, a
man of intelligence, and worthy to carry out the plans of
the Emperor Justinian. It is, indeed, a proof of the esteem
with which God regarded the Emperor, that He furnished
him with men who would be so useful in effecting his
designs, and we are compelled to admire the intelligence
of the Emperor, in being able to choose the most suitable
of mankind to carry out the noblest of his works.</p>

<p>The church consequently presented a most glorious
spectacle, extraordinary to those who beheld it, and altogether
incredible to those who are told of it. In height it
rises to the very heavens, and overtops the neighbouring
buildings like a ship anchored among them: it rises above
the rest of the city, which it adorns, while it forms a part of
it, and it is one of its beauties that being a part of the city,
and growing out of it, it stands so high above it, that from
it the whole city can be beheld as from a watch-tower.
Its length and breadth are so judiciously arranged that it
appears to be both long and wide without being disproportioned.
It is distinguished by indescribable beauty,
for it excels both in its size and in the harmony of its proportion,
having no part excessive and none deficient;
being more magnificent than ordinary buildings, and much
more elegant than those which are out of proportion. It
is singularly full of light and sunshine; you would declare
that the place is not lighted by the sun from without, but
that the rays are produced within itself, such an abundance
of light is poured into this church. Now the front
of the church (that is to say the part towards the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7"> 7</span>
sun, where the sacred mysteries are performed in honour
of God) is built as follows. The building rises from the
ground, not in a
straight line, but
set back somewhat
obliquely, and retreating
in the middle
into the form
of a half-circle, a
form which those
who are learned in
these matters call
semi-cylindrical,
rising perpendicularly. The upper part of this work ends
in the fourth part of a sphere,
and above it another crescent-shaped
structure is raised upon
the adjacent parts of the building,
admirable for its beauty, but
causing terror by the apparent
weakness of its construction; for
it appears not to rest upon a
secure foundation, but to hang
dangerously over the heads of
those within, although it is really
supported with especial firmness
and safety. On each side of
these there are columns standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8"> 8</span>
upon the floor, which themselves also are not placed
in a straight line, but arranged with an inward curve
of semicircular shape, one beyond another, like the
dancers in a chorus. These columns support above them
a crescent-shaped structure. Opposite this east wall is
built another wall containing the entrances, and upon
either side of it also stand columns with stonework above
them in a half-circle exactly like those previously described.
In the midst of the church are four masses of stone called
piers, two on the north and two on the south side, opposite
and equal to one another, having four columns in the
central space between each. These piers are composed
of large stones fitted together, the stones being carefully
selected and cleverly jointed into one another by the
masons, reaching to a great height. Looking at them you
would compare them to perpendicular cliffs. Upon these
four arches rise in a quadrilateral form. The extremities
of these arches join one another in pairs, and rest at their
ends upon these piers, while the other part of them rise to
a great height, and are suspended in the air. Two of these
arches, that is, those towards the rising and the setting
sun, are constructed over the empty air, but the remainder
have under them some stonework, with small columns.
Now above these arches is raised a circular building
of a spherical form through which the light of day first
shines; for the building, I imagine, overtops the whole
country, and has small openings left on purpose, so that
the places where these intervals in the construction occur
may serve for conductors of light. Thus far I imagine
the building is not incapable of being described, even by
a weak and feeble tongue. As the arches are arranged in
a quadrangular figure, the stonework between them takes
the shape of a triangle; the lower angle of each triangle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9"> 9</span>
being compressed between the shoulders of the arches, is
slender, while the upper part becomes wider as it rises in
the space between them, and ends against the circle which
rises from thence, forming there its remaining angles. A
spherical-shaped dome standing upon this circle makes it
exceedingly beautiful; from the lightness of the building
it does not appear to rest upon a solid foundation, but to
cover the place beneath as though it were suspended from
heaven by the fabled golden chain. All these parts surprisingly
joined to one another in the air, suspended one
from another, and resting only on that which is next to
them, form the work into one admirably harmonious whole,
which spectators do not care to dwell upon for long in the
mass, as each individual part attracts the eye and turns it
to itself. The sight causes men to constantly change their
point of view, and the spectator can nowhere point to any
part which he admires more than the rest, but having
viewed the art which appears everywhere, men contract
their eyebrows as they look at each point, and are unable
to comprehend such workmanship, but always depart
thence stupified through their incapacity to comprehend
it. So much for this.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justinian and the architects Anthemius
and Isidorus used many devices to construct so lofty a
church with security. One alone of these I will at this
present time explain, by which a man may form some
opinion of the strength of the whole work; as for the others,
I am not able to discover them all, and find it impossible to
explain them in words. It is as follows:—The piers<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10"> 10</span>
which I just now spoke are not constructed in the same
manner as the rest of the building, but in this fashion: they
consist of quadrangular courses of stones, rough by nature,
but made smooth by art; of these stones, those which
make the projecting angles of the pier are cut angularly,
while those which go in the middle parts of the sides are
cut square. They are fastened together not with what is
called unslaked lime, not with bitumen, the boast of
Semiramis at Babylon, nor anything of the kind, but with
lead, which is poured between the interstices, and which,
pervading the whole structure, has sunk into the joints of
the stones, and binds them together; this is how they are
built. Let us now proceed to describe the remaining parts
of the church. The entire ceiling is covered with pure
gold, which adds glory to its beauty, though the rays of
light reflected upon the gold from the marble surpass it
in beauty; there are two porticos on each side, which do
not in any way dwarf the size of the church, but add to its
width. In length they reach quite to the ends, but in
height they fall short of it; these also have a domed
ceiling and are adorned with gold. Of these two porticos,
the one is set apart for male, and the other for female
worshippers; there is no variety in them, nor do they
differ in any respect from one another, but their very
equality and similarity add to the beauty of the church.
Who could describe the galleries<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the portion set apart
for women, or the numerous porticos and cloistered courts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11"> 11</span>
with which the church is surrounded? who could tell of
the beauty of the columns and marbles with which the
church is adorned? one would think that one had come
upon a meadow full of flowers in bloom: who would not
admire the purple tints of some and the green of others,
the glowing red and glittering white, and those, too, which
nature, like a painter, has marked with the strongest contrasts
of colour? Whoever enters there to worship perceives
at once that it is not by any human strength or
skill, but by the favour of God that this work has been perfected;
his mind rises sublime to commune with God, feeling
that He cannot be far off, but must especially love to
dwell in the place which He has chosen; and this takes
place not only when a man sees it for the first time, but it
always makes the same impression upon him, as though he
had never beheld it before. No one ever became weary
of this spectacle, but those who are in the Church delight
in what they see, and, when they leave it, magnify it in
their talk about it; moreover, it is impossible accurately
to describe the treasure of gold and silver plate and gems,
which the Emperor Justinian has presented to it; but by
the description of one of them, I leave the rest to be
inferred. That part of the church which is especially
sacred, and where the priests alone are allowed to enter,
which is called the Sanctuary, contains forty thousand
pounds’ weight of silver!</p>

<p>The above is an account, written in the most abridged
and cursory manner, describing in the fewest possible
words the most admirable structure of the church at Constantinople
which is called the Great Church, built by the
Emperor Justinian, who did not merely supply the funds
for it, but assisted it by the labour and powers of his
mind, as I will now explain. Of the two arches which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12"> 12</span>
lately mentioned (the architects call them ‘lori’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>), that one
which stands towards the east had been built up on each
side, but had not altogether been completed in the middle,
where it was still imperfect; now the piers upon which
the building rested, unable to support the weight which
was put upon them, somehow all at once split open, and
seemed as though before long they would fall to pieces.
Upon this Anthemius and Isidorus, terrified at what had
taken place, referred the matter to the Emperor, losing all
confidence in their own skill. He at once, I know not by
what impulse, but probably inspired by heaven, for he is
not an architect, ordered them to carry round this arch;
for it, said he, resting upon itself, will no longer need the
piers below. Now if this story were unsupported by
witnesses, I am well assured that it would seem to be
written in order to flatter, and to be quite incredible; but
as there are many witnesses now alive of what then took
place, I shall not hesitate to finish it. The workmen
performed his bidding, the arch was safely suspended, and
proved by experiment the truth of his conception. So
much then for this part of the building; now with regard
to the other arches, those looking to the south and to the
north, the following incidents took place. When the
arches called ‘lori’ were raised aloft during the building of
the church, everything below them laboured under their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13"> 13</span>
weight, and the columns which are placed there shed little
scales, as though they had been planed. Alarmed at this,
the architects again referred the matter to the Emperor,
who devised the following plan. He ordered the upper
part of the work that was giving way, where it touched
the arches, to be taken down for the present, and to be
replaced long afterwards when the damp had thoroughly
left the fabric. This was done, and the building has
stood safely afterwards, so that the structure as it were
bears witness to the Emperor.</p>

<p>II. In front of the Senate House there is an open place
which the people of Constantinople call the Augustæum:
in it there are not less than seven courses of stone in
a quadrangular form, arranged like steps, each one so
much less in extent than that which is below, that each
one of the stones projects sufficiently for the men who frequent
that place to sit upon them as upon steps. From
the topmost course a column rises to a great height—not
a monolith, but composed of stones of a considerable periphery,
which are cut square, and are fitted into one another
by the skill of the masons. The finest brass, cast into panels
and garlands, surrounds these stones on every side, binding
them firmly together, while it covers them with ornament,
and in all parts, especially at the capital and the
base, imitates the form of the column. This brass is in
colour paler than unalloyed gold; and its value is not
much short of its own weight in silver. On the summit
of the column there stands an enormous horse, with his
face turned towards the east—a noble sight. He appears to
be walking, and proceeding swiftly forwards; he raises his
left fore-foot as though to tread upon the earth before
him, while the other rests upon the stone beneath it, as
though it would make the next step, while he places his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14"> 14</span>
hind feet together, so that they may be ready when he
bids them move. Upon this horse sits a colossal brass
figure of the Emperor, habited as Achilles, for so his
costume is called; he wears hunting-shoes, and his ankles
are not covered by his greaves. He wears a corslet like
an ancient hero, his head is covered by a helmet which
seems to nod, and a plume glitters upon it. A poet would
say that it was that ‘star of the dog-days’ mentioned in
Homer.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He looks towards the east, directing his course,
I imagine, against the Persians; in his left hand he holds
a globe, by which the sculptor signifies that all lands and
seas are subject to him. He holds no sword or spear, or
any other weapon, but a cross stands upon the globe,
through which he has obtained his empire and victory in
war; he stretches forward his right hand towards the east,
and spreading out his fingers seems to bid the barbarians
in that quarter to remain at home and come no further.
This is the appearance of the statue.</p>

<p>The Church of Irene,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which was next to the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15"> 15</span>
church, and was burnt down together with it, was rebuilt
on a large scale by the Emperor Justinian—a church
scarcely second to any in Byzantium except that of
Sophia. There was between these two churches a hospice
for the relief of destitute persons and those in the last
extremity of disease, suffering in body as well as in fortune,
which was built in former times by a God-fearing man
named Sampson. This also did not remain unscathed
by the insurgents, but perished in the fire, together with
the two neighbouring churches. The Emperor Justinian
rebuilt it in a more magnificent fashion, and with a much
greater number of rooms, and he has also endowed it with
a great annual revenue, in order that the sufferings of more
unfortunate men may be relieved in it for the future. Insatiate
as he was in his love for God, he built two other
hospices opposite to this, in what are called the houses of
Isidorus and Arcadius, being assisted in these pious works
by the Empress Theodora. As for all the other churches
which this Emperor raised in honour of Christ, they are
so many in number and so great in size that it is impossible
to describe them in detail, for no power of words nor
one’s whole life would suffice to collect and to recite the
list of their several names: let this much suffice.</p>

<p>III. We must begin with the churches of the Virgin
Mary, for it is understood that this is the wish of the
Emperor himself, and the true method of description distinctly
points out that from God we ought to proceed to
the Mother of God. The Emperor Justinian built in all
parts of the Roman empire many churches dedicated to
the Virgin, so magnificent and large, and constructed with
such a lavish expenditure of money, that a person beholding
any one of them singly would imagine it to have been
his only work, and that he had spent the whole period of
his reign in adorning it alone. For the present, as I said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16"> 16</span>
before, I shall describe the churches in Byzantium. One
of the churches of the Virgin<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was built by him outside
the walls, in a place named Blachernæ (for he must be
credited with the pious foundations of Justin, his uncle,
since he administered his kingdom at his own discretion).
This church is near the sea-shore, of great sanctity and
magnificence; it is long, yet its width is well proportioned
to its length, and above and below it is supported and
rests on nothing less than sections of Parian marble which
stand in the form of columns. These columns are arranged
in a straight line in all parts of the church except in the
middle, where they are set back. Those who enter this
church especially admire its lofty and at the same time
secure construction, and its splendid yet not meretricious
beauty.</p>

<p>He built another church in her honour in the place
which is called the Fountain, where there is a thick grove
of cypress trees, a meadow whose rich earth blooms with
flowers, a garden abounding in fruit, a fountain which
noiselessly pours forth a quiet and sweet stream of water,
in short where all the surroundings beseem a sacred place.
Such is the country around the church; but as for the
church itself, it is not easy to describe it in fitting words,
to form an idea of it in the mind, or to express it in
language; let it suffice for me to say thus much of it, that
in beauty and size it surpasses most other churches.
Both these churches are built outside the city walls, the
one at the place where the wall starts from the sea-shore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17"> 17</span>
the latter close to what is called the Golden Gate, which
is near the further end of the fortifications, in order that
both of them might form impregnable defences for the
city walls. Besides these, in the temple of Hera, now
called the Hiereum, he erected a church in honour of the
Virgin, which cannot easily be described.</p>

<p>In that part of the city which is called Deuteron<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he
built a noble and admirable church in honour of St. Anne,
whom some think to have been the mother of the Virgin,
and the grandmother of Christ; for God, in choosing to
become man, subjected Himself to having grand-parents
and a genealogy on His mother’s side like a man. Not
very far from this church, in the last street of the city,
there is a fine church built in honour of the martyr Zoe.</p>

<p>He found the church of the Archangel Michael<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at Byzantium
small, very dark, and quite unworthy of being dedicated
to the archangel, having been built by one Senator,
a patrician in former times, and in shape very like a small
bedroom in a poor man’s house. Wherefore he razed it
entirely to the ground, that no part of its former unseemliness
might be left, and rebuilding it of a goodly size, in
the manner which we now see, changed it into a building
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18"> 18</span>
of wonderful beauty. This church is of a quadrangular
form, its length apparently not greatly exceeding its
width; of its sides, that which looks towards the east has
at its extremities a thick wall constructed of a great mass
of stones, but in the middle is set back, forming a recess,
on each side of which the roof is supported by columns of
variegated stone. The opposite wall, that towards the
west, is pierced with doors opening into the church.</p>

<p>IV. His faith in the Apostles of Christ is testified in the
following manner: In the first place he built the Church
to SS. Peter and Paul, which did not exist before in
Byzantium, close to the King’s palace, which was formerly
called by the name of Hormisdas.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This was once his
own private house; and when he became Emperor of the
Romans, he made it look worthy of a palace by the
magnificence of its buildings, and joined it to the other
imperial apartments. Here also he built another church
dedicated to the glorious saints Sergius and Bacchus,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19"> 19</span>
afterwards another church standing obliquely to it.
These two churches stand, not facing one another, but
obliquely towards one another, joined together, and vying
one with another. They have a common entrance, are
equal to one another in all respects, are surrounded by a
boundary wall, and neither of them exceeds the other or
falls short of it, either in beauty, size, or any other respect;
for each alike reflects the rays of the sun from its polished
marble, and is alike covered with lavish gilding and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20"> 20</span>
adorned with offerings; in one respect alone they differ,
that the length of one is straight, whereas the columns of
the other for the most part stand in a semicircle. They
both have one portico at their vestibule, which from its
great length is called Narthex.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The whole vestibule,
the court, the inner doors from the court and the neighbourhood
of the palace are alike common to both, and
both these churches are so admirable that they form a
great ornament to the entire city, and especially to the
palace.</p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF CHURCH OF

</div>


<p>After this, out of his exceeding great reverence for all the
Apostles,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> he did as follows. In ancient times there was
one church at Byzantium dedicated to all the Apostles, but
through length of time it had become ruinous, and seemed
not likely to stand much longer. Justinian took this entirely
down, and was careful not only to rebuild it, but to render
it more admirable both in size and beauty; he carried out
his intention in the following manner. Two lines were
drawn in the form of a cross, joining one another in the
middle, the upright one pointing to the rising and setting
sun, and the other cross line towards the north and the
south wind. These were surrounded by a circuit of walls,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21"> 21</span>
and within by columns placed both above and below; at
the crossing of the two straight lines, that is, about the
middle point of them, there is a place set apart, which
may not be entered except by the priests, and which is consequently
termed the Sanctuary. The transepts which lie
on each side of this, about the cross line, are of equal
length; but that part of the upright line towards the
setting sun is built so much longer than the other part as
to form the figure of the cross. That part of the roof
which is above the Sanctuary is constructed like the
middle part of the Church of Sophia, except that it yields
to it in size; for the four arches are suspended and connected
with one another in the same fashion, the circular
building standing above them is pierced with windows,
and the spherical dome which overarches it seems to be
suspended in the air, and not to stand upon a firm base,
although it is perfectly secure. In this manner the middle
part of the roof is built: now the roof over the four limbs
of the church is constructed of the same size as that
which I have described over the middle, with this one
exception, that the wall underneath the spherical part is
not pierced with windows. When he had completed
the building of this Sanctuary, the Apostles made it
evident to all that they were pleased and thoroughly
delighted with the honour paid them by the Emperor; for
the bodies of the Apostles Andrew, Luke, and Timothy,
which had before this been invisible and altogether unknown,
were then made manifest to all men, signifying, I
imagine, that they did not reject the faith of the Emperor,
but permitted him openly to behold them, to approach and
to touch them, that he might gain from them assistance
and security for his life. This was discovered in the following
manner.</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantine built this church in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22"> 22</span>
name and in honour of the Apostles, making a decree that
there should be a sepulchre there for himself, and for
those who should rule after him, women as well as men;
which is observed even to the present day. Here also the
body of the father of Constantine was laid; but he did not
in any way hint that the bodies of the Apostles were there,
nor did there appear to be any place set apart for the
bodies of saints. When, however, the Emperor Justinian
was rebuilding this church, the workmen dug up the
whole foundation, lest any unseemly thing should be left
in it. They saw there three neglected wooden coffins,
which declared by inscriptions upon them that they contained
the bodies of the Apostles Andrew, Luke, and
Timothy, which the Emperor and all Christian men
beheld with the greatest delight. A solemn procession
and public festival was ordered, and, after the customary
rites had been performed in their honour, the coffins were
covered up, and again placed in the ground. The place
was not left unmarked or uncared for, but was reverently
dedicated to the bodies of the Apostles. In return for the
respect paid them by the Emperor, the Apostles, as I said
before, made themselves manifest to all men; for, under a
religious prince, the host of heaven do not hold themselves
aloof from the affairs of men, but love to mingle with
them, and rejoice in intercourse with mankind.</p>

<p>Who could be silent about the Church of Acacius,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
which, being ruinous, he pulled down and built up again
from its very foundations, adding wonderfully to its size?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23"> 23</span>
It rests on all sides upon brilliantly white columns, and its
floor is covered with similar marble, from which so bright
a light is reflected as to make one imagine that the whole
church is covered with snow. Two porticos stand in
front of it, the one supported on columns, and the other
looking towards the forum. I was within a little of
omitting to mention the church which was dedicated to
St. Plato the Martyr,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a truly worthy and noble building,
not far from the forum, which is named after the Emperor
Constantine; and likewise the church dedicated to the
Martyr Mocius,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which is the largest of all these churches.
Besides this, there is the Church of the Martyr Thyssus,
and the Church of St. Theodorus,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> standing outside
the city in the place which is called Rhesias, and the
Church of the Martyr Thecla, which is near the harbour
named after Julian, and that of St. Theodota in the
suburb which is called Hebdomon. All these were built
from their foundations by this Emperor during the reign
of his uncle Justin, and are not easy to describe in words,
while it is impossible to admire them sufficiently when
beholding them. My narrative is now attracted to the
Church of St. Agathonicus,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and I am forced to mention it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24"> 24</span>
though I have no longer voice nor words befitting such a
work: let it be sufficient for me to have said thus much
of it; I will leave the description of its beauty and
sumptuousness in all respects to others to whom the
subject is fresh, and who are not wearied out by their
labours.</p>

<p>V. Finding other churches in what is called the Anaplus,
and along the coast of the opposite continent, which were
not worthy to be dedicated to any of the saints, as also
round the gulf which the natives call Ceras,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> after the
name of Ceroessa, the mother of Byzans, who was the
founder of the city, he showed a royal munificence in all
of them, as I will presently prove, having first said a few
words about the glory which the sea adds to Byzantium.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Byzantium is increased by the sea
which enfolds it, contracting itself into straits, and connecting
itself with the ocean, thus rendering the city
remarkably beautiful, and affording a safe protection in its
harbours to seafarers, so as to cause it to be well supplied
with provisions and abounding with all necessaries; for
the two seas which are on either side of it, that is to say
the Ægean and that which is called the Euxine, which
meet at the east part of the city and dash together
as they mingle their waves, separate the continent by
their currents, and add to the beauty of the city while
they surround it. It is, therefore, encompassed by three
straits connected with one another, arranged so as to
minister both to its elegance and its convenience, all of
them most charming for sailing on, lovely to look at, and
exceedingly safe for anchorage. The middle one of them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25"> 25</span>
which leads from the Euxine Sea, makes straight for the
city as though to adorn it. Upon either side of it lie the
several continents, between whose shores it is confined,
and seems to foam proudly with its waves because it passes
over both Asia and Europe in order to reach the city; you
would think that you beheld a river flowing towards you
with a gentle current. That which is on the left hand of
it rests on either side upon widely extended shores, and
displays the groves, the lovely meadows, and all the other
charms of the opposite continent in full view of the city.
As it makes its way onward towards the south, receding
as far as possible from Asia, it becomes wider; but even
then its waves continue to encircle the city as far as the
setting of the sun. The third arm of the sea joins the
first one upon the right hand, starting from the place called
Sycæ,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and washes the greater part of the northern shore
of the city, ending in a bay. Thus the sea encircles the
city like a crown, the interval consisting of the land lying
between it in sufficient quantity to form a clasp for the
crown of waters. This gulf is always calm, and never
crested into waves, as though a barrier were placed there
to the billows, and all storms were shut out from thence,
through reverence for the city. Whenever strong winds
and gales fall upon these seas and this strait, ships, when
they once reach the entrance of this gulf, run the rest of
their voyage unguided, and make the shore at random;
for the gulf extends for a distance of more than forty
stadia in circumference, and the whole of it is a harbour,
so that when a ship is moored there the stern rests on
the sea and the bows on the land, as though the two elements
contended with one another to see which of them
could be of the greatest service to the city.</p>

<p>VI. Such is the appearance of this gulf; but the Emperor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26"> 26</span>
Justinian rendered it more lovely by the beauty of the
buildings with which he surrounded it; for on the left side of
it, he, to speak briefly, altered the Church of St. Laurentius
the Martyr, which formerly was without windows and very
dark,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> into the appearance which it now presents; and in
front of it he built the Church of the Virgin, in the place
which is called Blachernæ, as I described a little above.
Behind it he built a new church to SS. Priscus and
Nicolaus, renewing the whole building. This is an
especially favourite resort of the people of Byzantium,
partly from their respect and reverence for the saints, which
were their countrymen, and partly to enjoy the beauty of
the situation of the church; for the Emperor drove back
the waves of the sea, and laid the foundations as far among
the billows as possible. At the upper part of the gulf, in
a very steep and precipitous place, there was an ancient
Church of SS. Cosmas and Damianus; where once these
saints appeared on a sudden to the Emperor as he lay
grievously sick and apparently at the point of death, given
up by his physicians, and already reckoned as dead, and
miraculously made him whole. In order to repay their
goodness, as far as a mortal man may do, he entirely altered
and renewed the former building, which was unseemly
and humble, and not worthy to be dedicated to such great
saints, adorned the new church with beauty and size and
brilliant light, and gave it many other things which it did
not formerly possess. When men are suffering from
diseases beyond the reach of physicians, and despair of
human aid, they resort to the only hope which is left to
them, and sail through this gulf in boats to this church.
As soon as they begin their voyage they see this church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27"> 27</span>
standing as though on a lofty citadel, made beautiful by
the gratitude of the Emperor, and affording them hope
that they too may partake of the benefits which flow from
thence.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the gulf the Emperor built a
church which did not exist before, quite close to the shore
of the gulf, and dedicated it to the Martyr Anthimus. The
base of this temple, laved by the gentle wash of the sea,
is most picturesque; for no lofty billows dash against its
stones, nor does the wave resound like that of the open
sea, or burst into masses of foam, but gently glides up to
the land, silently laps against it, and quietly retreats.
Beyond this is a level and very smooth court, adorned all
round with marble columns, and rendered beautiful by its
view of the sea. Next to this is a portico, beyond which
rises the church, of a quadrangular form, adorned with
beautiful marble and gildings. Its length only exceeds its
breadth far enough to give room for the sanctuary, in
which the sacred mysteries are performed, on the side
which is turned towards the rising sun; such is the description
of it.</p>

<p>VII. Beyond this, at the very mouth of the gulf, stands
the Church of the Martyr Irene,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which the Emperor has
so magnificently constructed that I could not competently
describe it; for, contending with the sea in his desire to
beautify the gulf, he has built these churches as though he
were placing gems upon a necklace; however, since I
have mentioned this Church of Irene, it will not be
foreign to my purpose to describe what took place there.
Here, from ancient times, rested the remains of no fewer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28"> 28</span>
than forty saints, who were Roman soldiers, and were
enrolled in the twelfth legion, which formerly was stationed
in the city of Melitene, in Armenia; now, when
the masons dug in the place which I just spoke of, they
found a chest with an inscription stating that it contained
the remains of these men. This chest, which had been
forgotten, was at that time purposely brought to light by
God, both with the object of proving to all men with how
great joy He received the gifts of the Emperor, and also
in order to reward his good works by the bestowal of a
still greater favour; for the Emperor Justinian was in ill-health,
and a large collection of humours in his knee
caused him great pain. His illness arose from his own
fault; for during all the days which precede the Paschal
Feast, and are called fast-days, he practised a severe
abstinence, unfit not only for a prince, but even for a man
who took no part in political matters. He used to pass
two days entirely without food, and that, too, although he
rose from his bed at early dawn to watch over the State,
whose business he ever transacted, both by actions and
words, early in the morning, at midday, and at night with
equal zeal; for though he would retire to rest late at night,
he would almost immediately arise, as though disliking his
bed. Whenever he did take nourishment, he refrained
from wine, bread, and all other food, eating only herbs,
and those wild ones which had been for a long time
pickled in salt and vinegar, whilst water was his only
drink. Yet he never ate to repletion even of these; but
whenever he dined, he would merely taste this food, and
then push it away, never eating sufficient. From this
regimen his disease gathered strength, defying the efforts
of physicians, and for a long time the Emperor suffered
from these pains. During this time, hearing of the
discovery of the relics, he disregarded human art, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"> 29</span>
commended himself to them, deriving health from his
faith in them, and finding healing in his bitterest need
from his true faith; for as soon as the priests placed the
paten upon his knee, the disease at once vanished—forced
out of a body dedicated to God. Not wishing that this
matter should be disputed, God displayed a great sign as
a testimony to this miracle. Oil suddenly poured forth
from the holy relics, overflowed the chest, and besprinkled
the feet and the purple garment of the Emperor. Wherefore
his tunic, thus saturated, is preserved in the palace as
a testimony of what then took place, and for the healing
of those who in future time may suffer from incurable
disorders.</p>

<p>VIII. Thus did the Emperor Justinian adorn the gulf
which is called the Horn; he also added great beauty to
the shores of the other two straits, of which I lately
made mention, in the following manner. There were two
churches dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, opposite
to one another, on either side of the strait, the one in the
place called Anaplus<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> on the left hand as one sails into
the Euxine Sea, and the other on the opposite shore.
This place was called Pröochthus by the ancients—I suppose
because it projects a long way from that shore—and
is now called Brochi, the ignorance of the inhabitants
having in process of time corrupted the name. The
priests of these two churches, perceiving that they were
dilapidated by age, and fearing that they might presently
fall down upon them, besought the Emperor to restore
them both to their former condition; for in his reign it
was not possible for a church either to be built, or to be
restored when ruined, except from the royal treasury, and
that not only in Byzantium, but also everywhere throughout
the Roman Empire. The Emperor, as soon as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30"> 30</span>
obtained this opportunity, demolished both of them to
the foundation, that no part of their former unseemliness
might be left. He rebuilt the one in Anaplus<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in the
following manner. He formed the shore into a curve
within a mole of stone, which he erected as a protection
to the harbour, and changed the sea-beach into the
appearance of a market; for the sea, which is there very
smooth, exchanges its produce with the land, and sea-faring
merchants, mooring their barques alongside the
mole, exchange the merchandise from their decks for the
produce of the country. Beyond this sea-side market
stands forth the vestibule of the church, whose marble
vies in colour with ripe fruit and snow. Those who take
their walks in this quarter are charmed with the beauty
of the stone, are delighted with the view of the sea, and
are refreshed with the breezes from the water and the
hills which rise upon the land. A circular portico surrounds
the church on all sides except the east. In the
midst of it stands the church, adorned with marble of
various colours. Above it is suspended a domed roof.
Who, after viewing it, could speak worthily of the lofty
porticoes, of the buildings within, of the grace of the
marble with which the walls and foundations are everywhere
encrusted? In addition to all this, a great quantity
of gold is everywhere spread over the church, as though
it grew upon it. In describing this, I have also described
the Church of St. John the Baptist,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> which the Emperor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31"> 31</span>Justinian lately erected in his honour in the place called
Hebdomon; for both the two churches are very like each
other, except only that the Church of the Baptist does not
happen to stand by the sea-shore.</p>

<p>The Church of the Archangel, in the place called
Anaplus, is built in the above manner; now upon the
opposite shore there is a place at a little distance from
the sea, which is level, and raised high upon a mass of
stones. Here has been built a church in honour of the
Archangel, of exceeding beauty, of the largest size, and
in costliness worthy of being dedicated to the Archangel
Michael by the Emperor Justinian. Not far from this
church, he restored a church of the Virgin, which had
fallen into ruins long before, whose magnificence it would
take long to examine and to express in words; but here a
long-expected part of our history finds its place.</p>

<p>IX. Upon this shore there stood from ancient times a
beautiful palace: the whole of this the Emperor Justinian
dedicated to God, exchanging present enjoyment for the
reward of his piety hereafter, in the following manner.
There were at Byzantium a number of women who were
prostituted in a brothel, not willingly, but compelled to
exercise their profession; for under pressure of poverty
they were compelled by the procurer who kept them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32"> 32</span>
act in this manner, and to offer themselves to unknown
and casual passers-by. There was here from ancient
times a guild of brothel-keepers, who not only carried on
their profession in this building, but publicly bought their
victims in the market, and forced them into an unchaste
life. However, the Emperor Justinian and the Empress
Theodora, who performed all their works of piety in
common, devised the following scheme. They cleansed
the State from the pollution of these brothels, drove out
the procurers, and set free these women who had been
driven to evil courses by their poverty, providing them
with a sufficient maintenance, and enabling them to live
chaste as well as free. This was arranged in the following
manner: they changed the palace, which stood on the
right hand as one sails into the Euxine Sea, into a magnificent
convent, to serve as a refuge for women who had
repented of their former life, in order that there spending
their lives in devotion to God, and in continual works of
piety, they might wash away the sins of their former life
of shame; wherefore this dwelling of these women is
called from their work by the name of the Penitentiary.
The princes endowed this convent with large revenues,
and furnished it with many buildings of exceeding great
beauty and costliness for the comfort of these women,
so that none of them might be forced by any circumstances
to relax their practice of chastity. So much then
for this part of the subject.</p>

<p>As one sails from this place towards the Euxine Sea,
there is a lofty promontory jutting out from the shore of the
strait, upon which stood a Church of the Martyr St. Pantelëemon,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
which, having been originally carelessly built,
and having been much ruined by lapse of time, was taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33"> 33</span>
down by the Emperor Justinian, who built the church which
now stands there with the greatest magnificence, and both
preserved the honour due to the martyr and added beauty
to the strait by building on each side of it the churches
which I have mentioned. Beyond this church, in a place
which is called Argyronium, there was, in old times, a
hospital for poor men afflicted with incurable diseases,
which having in the course of time fallen into the last
stage of decay, he most zealously restored, to serve as a
refuge for those who were thus afflicted. Near this place
there is a district by the sea-side called Mochadius, which
is also called Hieron. Here he built a temple in honour
of the Archangel of remarkable splendour, and in no respect
inferior to those Churches of the Archangel, of which
I spoke just now. He also built a church dedicated to St.
Tryphon the Martyr, decorated with much labour and
time to an indescribable pitch of beauty, in that street of
the city which is called by the name of ‘The Stork.’
Furthermore, he built a church in the Hebdomon, in
honour of the martyrs Menas<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and Menæsus; and finding
that the Church of St. Ias the Martyr, which is on the left
hand as one enters the Golden Gate, was in ruins, he
restored it with a lavish expenditure. This is what was
done by the Emperor Justinian in connection with the
churches in Byzantium; but to describe all his works
throughout the entire Roman Empire in detail, is a difficult
task, and altogether impossible to express in words,
but, whenever I shall have to make mention of the name
of any city or district, I shall take the opportunity of describing
the churches in it.</p>

<p>X. The above were the works of the Emperor Justinian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"> 34</span>
upon the churches of Constantinople and its suburbs; but
as to the other buildings constructed by him, it would not
be easy to mention them all. However, to sum up matters,
he rebuilt and much improved in beauty the largest and
most considerable part both of the city and of the palace,
which had been burned down and levelled with the ground.
It appears unnecessary for me to enter into particulars
on this subject at present, since it has all been minutely
described in my ‘History of the Wars.’ For the present
I shall only say this much, that the vestibule of the palace
and that which is called Chalce, as far as what is known
as the House of Ares, and outside the palace the public
baths of Zeuxippus,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and the great porticoes and all the
buildings on either hand, as far as the forum of Constantine,
are the works of this Emperor. In addition to these,
he restored and added great magnificence to the house
named after Hormisdas, which stands close to the palace,
rendering it worthy of the palace, to which he joined it,
and thereby rendered it much more roomy and worthy of
admiration on that side.</p>

<p>In front of the palace there is a forum surrounded with
columns. The Byzantines call this forum the Augustæum.
I mentioned it in a former part of this work, when, after
describing the Church of St. Sophia, I spoke of the brazen
statue of the Emperor, which stands upon a very lofty
column of stones as a memorial of that work. On the
eastern side of this forum stands the Senate House, which
baffles description by its costliness and entire arrangement,
and which was the work of the Emperor Justinian. Here
at the beginning of every year the Roman Senate holds
an annual festival, according to the custom of the State.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35"> 35</span>
Six columns stand in front of it, two of them having between
them that wall of the Senate House which looks
towards the west, while the four others stand a little beyond
it. These columns are all white in colour, and in
size, I imagine, are the largest columns in the whole
world. They form a portico covered by a circular dome-shaped
roof. The upper parts of this portico are all
adorned with marble equal in beauty to that of the
columns, and are wonderfully ornamented with a number
of statues standing on the roof.</p>

<p>Not far from this forum stands the Emperor’s palace,
which, as I have said before, was almost entirely rebuilt
by the Emperor Justinian. To describe it all in words
is impossible, but it will suffice for future generations
to know that it was all the work of this Emperor.
As, according to the proverb, we know the lion by his
claw, so my readers will learn the magnificence of this
palace from the entrance-hall. This entrance-hall is the
building called Chalce; its four walls stand in a quadrangular
form, and are very lofty; they are equal to one
another in all respects, except that those on the north and
south sides are a little shorter than the others. In each
angle of them stands a pier of very well-wrought stone,
reaching from the floor to the summit of the wall, quadrangular
in form and joining the wall on one of its sides:
they do not in any way destroy the beauty of the place,
but even add ornament to it by the symmetry of their
position. Above them are suspended eight arches, four
of which support the roof, which rises above the whole
work in a spherical form, whilst the others, two of which
rest on the neighbouring wall towards the south and two
towards the north, support the arched roof which is suspended
over those spaces. The entire ceiling is decorated
with paintings, not formed of melted wax poured upon it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36"> 36</span>
but composed of tiny stones adorned with all manner of
colours, imitating human figures and everything else in
nature. I will now describe the subjects of these paintings.
Upon either side are wars and battles, and the capture
of numberless cities, some in Italy, and some in Libya.
Here the Emperor Justinian conquers by his General
Belisarius; and here the General returns to the Emperor,
bringing with him his entire army unscathed, and offers
to him the spoils of victory, kings, and kingdoms, and all
that is most valued among men. In the midst stand the
Emperor and the Empress Theodora, both of them seeming
to rejoice and hold high festival in honour of their
victory over the kings of the Vandals and the Goths, who
approach them as prisoners of war led in triumph. Around
them stands the Senate of Rome, all in festal array, which
is shown in the mosaic by the joy which appears on their
countenances; they swell with pride and smile upon the
Emperor, offering him honours as though to a demi-god,
after his magnificent achievements. The whole interior,
not only the upright parts, but also the floor itself, is encrusted
with beautiful marbles, reaching up to the mosaics
of the ceiling. Of these marbles, some are of a Spartan
stone equal to emerald, while some resemble a flame of
fire; the greater part of them are white, yet not a plain
white, but ornamented with wavy lines of dark blue.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> So
much for this building.</p>

<p>XI. As one sails from the Propontis towards the eastern
part of the city, there is a public bath on the left hand
which is called the Baths of Arcadius, and which forms an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"> 37</span>
ornament to the city of Constantinople, great as it is.
Here our Emperor constructed a court standing outside
the city, intended as a promenade for the inhabitants, and
a mooring-place for those who sail past it. This court is
lighted by the sun when rising, but is conveniently shaded
when he proceeds towards the west. Round it the sea
flows quietly with a gentle stream, coming like a river
from the main sea, so that those who are taking their
walks in it are able to converse with those who are
sailing; for the sea reaches up to the basement of the
court with great depth, navigable for ships, and by its
remarkable calm enables those on the water and on the
land to converse with one another. Such is the side of
the court which looks upon the sea, adorned with the
view over it, and refreshed with the gentle breezes from it.
Its basement, its columns, and its entablature are all
covered with marble of great beauty, whose colour is of a
most brilliant white, which glitters magnificently in the
rays of the sun; moreover, many statues adorn it, some of
brass and some of marble, composing a sight well worth
mention; one would conjecture that they were the work
of Phidias the Athenian, of Lysippus of Sicyon, or of
Praxiteles. Here also is a statue of the Empress
Theodora on a column, which was erected in her honour
by the city as an offering of gratitude for this court. The
face of the statue is beautiful, but falls short of the beauty
of the Empress, since it is utterly impossible for any mere
human workmen to express her loveliness, or to imitate it
in a statue; the column is of porphyry, and clearly shows
by its magnificent appearance that it carries the Empress,
before one sees the statue.</p>

<p>I will now explain the Emperor’s works to afford an
abundant supply of water to the city. In summer-time
the imperial city used for the most part to suffer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38"> 38</span>
scarcity of water, although at other seasons it had sufficient;
for at that time, in consequence of the drought, the
fountains flowed less plenteously than at other seasons,
and supplied the aqueducts of the city very sparingly.
Wherefore the Emperor devised the following plan. In
the Portico of the Emperor, where the advocates, and
magistrates, and other persons connected with the law
transact business, there is a very lofty court of great
length and width, quadrangular in shape, and surrounded
with columns, which is not constructed upon an earthen
foundation, but upon the rock itself. Four porticos
surround this court, one upon each side of it. The
Emperor Justinian excavated one of these porticos, that
upon the south side, to a great depth, and stored up there
the superfluity of water from the other seasons for use in
summer. These cisterns receive the overflow from the
aqueducts, when they are too full of water, giving them a
place to overflow into, and afford a supply in time of need
when water becomes scarce. Thus did the Emperor
Justinian arrange that the people of Byzantium should
not want for sweet water.</p>

<p>He also built new palaces elsewhere, one in the Heræum,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which is now called the Hiereum, and in the place called
Jucundiana. I am unable to describe either the magnificence
or exquisite workmanship, or the size of these
palaces in a manner worthy of the subject. Suffice it to
say that these palaces stand there, and were built in the
presence and according to the plans of Justinian, who
disregarded nothing except expense, which was so large
that the mind is unable to grasp it. Here also he con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39"> 39</span>structed
a sheltered harbour, which did not exist before.
Finding that the shore was exposed on both sides to the
winds and the violence of the waves, he arranged a place
of refuge for mariners in the following manner: he constructed
what are called chests, of countless number and
of great size, flung them into the sea on each side of the
beach in an oblique direction, and by continually placing
fresh layers in order upon the others, formed two walls in
the sea opposite to one another, reaching from the depths
below to the surface of the water on which the ships sail;
upon this he flung rough stones, which when struck by the
waves break their force, so that when a strong wind blows
in the winter season, everything between these walls
remains calm, an interval being left between them to
serve as an entrance for ships into the harbour. Here
also he built the churches which I formerly mentioned,
and also porticos, market-places, public baths, and everything
else of that sort; so that this palace in no respect
falls short of that within the city. He also built another
harbour on the opposite continent, in the place which is
called after the name of Eutropius, not very far from the
Heræum, constructed in the same manner as that which
I mentioned above.</p>

<p>The above are, described as briefly as possible, the works
of the Emperor Justinian in the imperial city. I will now
describe the only thing which remains. Since the Emperor
dwells here, a multitude of men of all nations comes
into the city from all the world, in consequence of the vast
extent of the empire, each one of them led thither either by
business, by hope, or by chance, many of whom, whose
affairs at home have fallen into disorder, come with the
intention of offering some petition to the Emperor. These
persons, forced to dwell in the city on account of some
present or threatened misfortune, in addition to their other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40"> 40</span>
trouble are also in want of lodging, being unable to pay
for a dwelling-place during their stay in the city. This
source of misery was removed from them by the Emperor
Justinian and the Empress Theodora, who built very large
hospices as places of refuge in time of need for such
unfortunate persons as these, close to the sea, in the place
which is called the Stadium, I suppose because in former
times it was used for public games.</p>

<p>I. The new churches which the Emperor Justinian built
in Constantinople and its suburbs, the churches which
were ruinous through age, and which he restored, and all
the other buildings which he erected there, are described
in my previous book; it remains that we should proceed to
the fortresses with which he encircled the frontier of the
Roman territory. This subject requires great labour, and
indeed is almost impossible to describe; we are not about
to describe the Pyramids, that celebrated work of the Kings
of Egypt, in which labour was wasted on a useless freak,
but all the strong places by means of which our Emperor
preserved the empire, and so fortified it as to render vain
any attempt of the barbarians against the Romans. I
think I should do well to start from the Median frontier.</p>

<p>When the Medes retired from the country of the Romans,
restoring to them the city of Amida,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> as has been narrated
in my ‘History of the Wars,’ the Emperor Anastasius
took great pains to build a wall round an, at that time,
unimportant village named Dara, which he observed was
situated near the Persian frontier, and to form it into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41"> 41</span>
city which would act as a bulwark against the enemy.
Since, however, by the terms of the treaty formerly made
by the Emperor Theodosius with the Persians, it was forbidden
that either party should build any new fortress on
their own ground in the neighbourhood of the frontier,
the Persians urged that this was forbidden by the articles
of the peace, and hindered the work with all their power,
although their attention was diverted from it by their war
with the Huns. The Romans, perceiving that on account
of this war they were unprepared, pushed on their building
all the more vigorously, being eager to finish the work
before the enemy should bring their war against the Huns
to a close and march against themselves. Being alarmed
through their suspicions of the enemy, and constantly expecting
an attack, they did not construct their building
carefully, but the quickness of building into which they
were forced by their excessive hurry prevented their work
being secure; for speed and safety are never wont to go
together, nor is swiftness often accompanied by accuracy.
They therefore built the city-walls in this hurried fashion,
not making a wall which would defy the enemy, but
raising it barely to the necessary height; nor did they
even place the stones in their right positions or arrange
them in due order, or fill the interstices with mortar. In
a short time, therefore, since the towers, through their
insecure construction, were far from being able to withstand
snow and hot sun, most of them fell into ruins.
Thus was the first wall built round the city of Dara.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42"> 42</span></p>

</div>

<p>It occurred to the Emperor Justinian that the Persians
would not, as far as lay in their power, permit this Roman
fortress to stand threatening them, but that they would
march against it with their entire force, and use every
device to assault its walls on equal terms; and that a
number of elephants would accompany them, bearing
wooden towers upon their backs, which towers instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43"> 43</span>
foundations would rest upon the elephants, who—and
this was the worst of all—could manœuvre round the city
at the pleasure of the enemy, and carry a wall which could
be moved whithersoever its masters might think fit; and
the enemy, mounted upon these towers, would shoot down
upon the heads of the Romans within the walls, and assail
them from above; they would also pile up mounds of
earth against the walls, and bring up to them all the
machines used in sieges; while if any misfortune should
befall the city of Dara, which was an outwork of the entire
Roman Empire and a standing menace to the enemy’s
country, the evil would not rest there, but the whole state
would be endangered to a great extent. Moved by these
considerations he determined to fortify the place in a
manner worthy of its value.</p>

<p>In the first place,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> therefore, since the wall was, as I
have described, very low, and therefore easily assailable,
he rendered it inaccessible and altogether impregnable.
He placed stones which so contracted the original battlements
as only to leave small traces of them, like windows,
allowing just so much opening to them as a hand could
be passed through, so that passages were left through
which arrows could be shot against the assailants. Above
these he built a wall to a height of about thirty feet, not
making the wall of the same thickness all the way to the
top, lest the foundations should be over-weighted by the
mass above, and the whole work be ruined; but he surrounded
the upper part with a course of stones, and built
a portico extending round the entire circuit of the walls,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44"> 44</span>
above which he placed the battlements, so that the wall
was throughout constructed of two stories, and the towers
of three stories, which could be manned by the defenders
to repel the attacks of the enemy; for over the middle of
the towers he constructed a vaulted roof, and again built
new battlements above it, thus making them into a fortification
consisting of three stories.</p>

<p>After this, though he saw, as I have said before, that
many of the towers had after a short time fallen into
ruin, yet he was not able to take them down, because the
enemy were always close at hand, watching their opportunity,
and always trying to find some unprotected part of
the fortifications. He therefore devised the following
plan: he left these towers where they were, and outside
of each of them he constructed another building with
great skill, in a quadrangular form, well and securely
built. In the same manner he securely protected the
ruinous parts of the walls with a second wall. One of
these towers, which was called the Watchtower, he
seized an opportunity of demolishing, rebuilt it securely,
and everywhere removed all fear of want of strength from
the walls. He wisely built the outside part of the wall
to a sufficient height, in due proportion; outside of it he
dug a ditch, not in the way in which men usually make
one, but in a small space, and in a different fashion. With
what object he did this, I will now explain.</p>

<p>The greater part of the walls are inaccessible to besiegers,
because they do not stand upon level ground, nor
in such a manner as would favour an attack, but upon
high precipitous rocks where it would not be possible to
undermine them, or to make any assault upon them; but
upon the side turned towards the south, the ground,
which is soft and earthy and easily dug, renders the city
assailable. Here, therefore, he dug a crescent-shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45"> 45</span>
ditch, deep and wide, and reaching to a considerable
distance. Each end of this ditch joined the city wall,
and by filling it with water he rendered it altogether impassable
to the enemy. On the inner side of it he built a
second wall, upon which during a siege the Roman soldiers
keep guard, without fear for the walls themselves and for
the other outwork which stands before the city. Between
the city wall and this outwork, opposite the gate which
leads towards Ammodius, there was a great mound, from
which the enemy were able to drive mines towards the
city unperceived. This he entirely removed, and levelled
the spot, so as to put it out of the enemy’s power to
assault the place from thence.</p>

<p>II. Thus did Justinian fortify this stronghold;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> he also
constructed reservoirs of water between the city walls and
the outwork, and very close to the Church of St. Bartholomew
the Apostle, on the west side. A river runs from
the suburb called Corde, distant about two miles from the
city. Upon either side of it rise two exceedingly rugged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"> 46</span>
mountains. Between the slopes of these mountains the
river runs as far as the city, and since it flows at the foot
of them, it is not possible for an enemy to divert or meddle
with its stream, for they cannot force it out of the hollow
ground. It is directed into the city in the following
manner. The inhabitants have built a great channel
leading to the walls, the mouth of which is closed with
numerous thick bars of iron, some upright and some
placed crosswise, so as to enable the water to enter the
city, without injury to the strength of its fortifications.
Thus the river enters the city, and after having filled these
reservoirs, and been led hither and thither at the pleasure
of the inhabitants, passes into another part of the city,
where there is an outfall constructed for it in the same
way as its entrance. The river in its progress through
the flat country made the city in former times easy to be
besieged, for it was not difficult for an enemy to encamp
there, because water was plentiful. The Emperor Justinian
considered this state of things, and tried to find
some remedy for it; God, however, assisted him in his
difficulty, took the matter into His own hands, and without
delay ensured the safety of the city. This took place
in the following manner.</p>

<p>One of the garrison of the city, either in consequence
of a dream or led of his own accord to it, collected together
a great number of the workmen engaged in building
the fortifications, and ordered them to dig a long
trench in a certain place, which he pointed out to them, a
considerable distance within the city wall, declaring that
they would there find sweet water flowing out of the
ground. He dug this trench in a circular form, making
the depth of it for the most part about fifteen feet. This
work proved the saving of the city, not through any foresight
of the workmen, yet, by means of this trench, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47"> 47</span>
would have been a misfortune was turned into a great
advantage to the Romans; for, as during this time very
heavy rain fell, the river, of which I just spoke, raged
outside the fortifications and rose to a great height, being
unable to proceed, because when it was swollen to such a
size neither the channel nor the entrances in the wall
were large enough to contain it, as they had been before.
It consequently piled up its waters against the wall, rising
to a great height and depth, and in some places was stagnant,
and in others rough and violent. It at once overthrew
the outwork, swept away a great part of the city
wall, forced its way through the city gates, and, running
with a great body of water, occupied almost the whole
city, invading both the market-place, the narrower streets,
and the houses themselves, swept off from them a great
mass of furniture, wooden vessels, and such like things,
and then, falling into this trench, disappeared under ground.
Not many days afterwards it reappeared near to the city
of Theodosiopolis, at a place about forty miles distant
from the city of Dara, where it was recognised by the
things which it had swept away out of the houses at Dara,
for there the whole mass of them reappeared. Since that
period, in time of peace and quiet, the river flows through
the midst of the city, fills the reservoirs with water, and
passes out of the city through the outfall especially constructed
for it by the builders of the city, which I described
above, and, as it supplies that region with water,
becomes a great boon to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.
When, however, a hostile army advances to besiege
the city, they close the passages through the iron gratings
with what are called sluice-doors, and at once force the
river to change its course and to flow into the trench and the
subterranean gulf beyond, so that the enemy suffer from
want of water and are at once obliged to raise the siege.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48"> 48</span>
Indeed Mirrhanes, the Persian general, in the reign of
Cabades, came thither to besiege the city, and was compelled
by all these difficulties to retire baffled after a short
time; and a long while afterwards, Chosroes himself advanced
with the same intentions, and attacked the city
with a numerous army; but being driven to great straits
through want of water, and perceiving the height of the
walls, he imagined the place to be entirely impregnable, gave
up his project, and straightway retired into Persia, being
out-generalled by the foresight of the Roman Emperor.</p>

<p>III. Such were the works of the Emperor Justinian in
the city of Dara. I shall now describe what he arranged
to prevent any second misfortune happening to the city
from the river, in which matter his wishes were manifestly
assisted by Heaven. There was one Chryses of Alexandria,
a clever engineer, who served the Emperor as an architect,
and constructed most of the works both in the city
of Dara and in the rest of the country. This Chryses was
absent when the misfortune from the river befell the city
of Dara; when he heard of it, he retired to bed in great grief,
and dreamed the following dream: A figure of more than
human stature appeared to him, and showed and explained
to him a device which would protect the city from any
dangerous inundation of the river. He, conceiving this
idea to be divinely inspired, at once wrote an account
of the device and of the vision, and sent it to the Emperor,
giving a sketch of what he had been taught in his dream.
It happened that not long before this a message reached
the Emperor from the city of Dara, giving him an account
of what had happened with the river. Thereupon the
Emperor, disturbed and alarmed at what had taken place,
straightway summoned those most celebrated architects,
Anthemius and Isidorus, whom I have mentioned before.
He informed them of what had happened, and inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49"> 49</span>
what arrangement could be devised to prevent this mischief
befalling the city a second time. Each of them
described what he considered to be a suitable plan for this
purpose; but the Emperor, evidently acting under a
divine impulse, although he had not yet seen the letter of
Chryses, miraculously invented and sketched out of his
own mind the plan suggested by the dream. The interview
terminated without the adoption of any distinct plan,
and without their deciding upon what was to be done; but
three days afterwards came a messenger to the Emperor,
who brought the letter from Chryses, and who explained
the form of the arrangement which he had seen in his
dream. The Emperor now again sent for the architects,
and ordered them to recall to mind their former ideas of
what ought to be done. They repeated everything in
order, both their own devices and the spontaneous inventions
of the Emperor; after which the Emperor brought
forward the messenger sent from Chryses, and showing
them the letter and the sketch of what he had seen in his
dream, caused them to wonder greatly, when they perceived
how Heaven had assisted our Emperor in everything
for the advantage of the Empire. The plan of the
Emperor accordingly won the day, and triumphed over
the art and learning of the architects. Chryses returned
to the city of Dara, with orders from the Emperor to carry
out the work which he had described with all speed, according
to the plan revealed in the dream. He carried out
his orders in the following manner.</p>

<p>In a place about forty feet distant from the outwork of
the city, across the valley in which the river runs between
the two mountains, he constructed a barrier of considerable
height and width, joining each end of it to the mountain on
either side, in such a manner that the water of the river
in its strongest flood could never force its way through it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50"> 50</span>
This work is called by those who are learned in such
matters a dam, or sluice, or whatever else they please.
He did not build this barrier in a straight line, but in the
form of a crescent, in order that its arch, which was
turned against the stream of the water, might be better
able to resist its violence. The upper and lower parts of
this barrier are pierced with apertures, so that, when the
river suddenly rises in flood, it is forced to stop there and
to flow no further with the entire weight of its stream,
but passing in small quantities through these apertures it
gradually diminishes in violence and power, and the wall
is never damaged by it; for the flow of water, collecting
in the place which, as I have said before, is about forty
feet in length, lying between the barrier and the outwork,
is never unmanageable, but runs gently to its usual
entrance, and thence is received in the artificial channel.
As for the gate, which the fury of the river broke open in
former times, he removed it from thence, and blocked up
its site with enormous stones, because this gate, being situated
on flat ground, was easily reached by the river when
in flood; but he placed the gate not far off, in a lofty place
in the most precipitous part of the circuit of the walls,
which it was impossible for the river to reach. Thus did
the Emperor arrange these matters.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this city suffered greatly from the
want of water, for there was no fountain springing out of
the ground, nor was any water carried about the streets
in an aqueduct, or stored up in cisterns; but those who
lived in the streets through which the river passed could
draw drinking-water from it without trouble, while those
who dwelt at a distance from the course of the river had
either to fetch their drinking-water with great trouble or
to perish with thirst; however, the Emperor Justinian
constructed a great aqueduct, by which he brought the
water to every part of the city, and relieved the distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51"> 51</span>
of the inhabitants. He also built two churches, that
which is called the Great Church, and the Church of St.
Bartholomew the Apostle.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Moreover, he built very spacious
barracks for the soldiers, that they might not inconvenience
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Not long after this he restored the wall and outworks
of the city of Amida, which had been built in former
times, and were thought likely to fall into ruins; thus
ensuring the safety of that city. I am now about to
speak of his buildings in the forts which stand on the
frontier of the territory of these cities.</p>

<p>IV. As one goes from the city of Dara towards the land
of Persia, there lies on the left a tract entirely impassable
for carriages or horses, extending to the distance of about
two days’ journey for a lightly-equipped traveller, ending
in an abrupt and precipitous place called Rhabdium.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
land on each side of this road to Rhabdium belongs for
a great distance to Persia. When I first saw this I was
surprised at it, and inquired of the people of the country
how it was that a road and tract belonging to the Romans
should have enemy’s land on each side of it. They
answered, that this country once belonged to the Persians,
but that at the request of the King of Persia one of
the Roman Emperors gave a village abounding in vines
near Martyropolis,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and received this region in exchange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52"> 52</span>
for it. The city of Rhabdium stands upon precipitous
and wild rocks, which there rise to a wondrous height;
below it is a region which they call ‘the field of the
Romans,’ out of wonder, I suppose, at its belonging to
the Romans, though it lies in the midst of the Persian
country. This Roman field lies on flat ground, and is
fruitful in all kinds of crops; one might conjecture this
from the fact that the Persian frontier surrounds it on
every side.</p>

<p>There is a very celebrated fort in Persia, named Sisauranum,
which the Emperor Justinian once captured and
razed to the ground; taking prisoners a great number of
Persian cavalry, together with their leader Bleschanes.
This place lies at a distance of two days’ journey from
Dara for a lightly-equipped traveller, and is about three
miles distant from Rhabdium. It was formerly unguarded,
and altogether neglected by the Romans, so that
it never received from them any garrison, fortification, or
any other benefit, wherefore the peasants who tilled this
country, of which I just spoke, besides the ordinary taxes,
paid an annual tribute of fifty gold pieces to the Persians,
in order that they might possess their lands and enjoy the
produce of them in security. All this was altered for them
by the Emperor Justinian, who enclosed Rhabdium with
fortifications, which he built upon the summit of the mountain
which rises there, and, taking advantage of the position
of the ground, rendered it impossible for the enemy
to approach it. As those who dwelt in it were in want of
water, there being no springs on the top of the cliff, he
constructed two cisterns, and by digging into the rocks in
many places made large reservoirs of water, so that the
rain-water might collect, and the garrison might use it
freely, and not be liable to capture through distress for
want of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53"> 53</span></p>

<p>He also rebuilt solidly, and gave their present beauty
and strength to all the other mountain forts, which reach
from this point and from the city of Dara to Amida;
namely, Ciphæ, Sauræ, Smargdis, Lurnes, Hieriphthon,
Atachæ, Siphris, Rhipalthæ, Banasymeon, and also
Sinæ, Rhasius, Dabanæ, and all the others which were
built there in ancient times, and which before this were
constructed in a contemptible fashion, but which he made
into an impregnable line of outposts along the Roman
frontier. In this region there stands a very lofty mountain,
precipitous, and altogether inaccessible; the plain
below it is rich and free from rocks, suitable both for
arable and pasture land, for it abounds in grass. There
are many villages at the foot of this mountain, whose
inhabitants are rich in the produce of the country, but lie
exposed to the attacks of the enemy. This was remedied
by the Emperor Justinian, who built a fort upon the
summit of the mountain, in which they might place their
most valued possessions, and themselves take refuge at
the approach of the enemy. This is named the Fort of
the Emperors. Moreover, he carefully rebuilt and safely
fortified the forts in the neighbourhood of the city of
Amida, which before were only surrounded by mud walls,
and were incapable of defence. Among these were
Apadnæ and the little fort of Byrthum: for it is not easy
to set down all their names in detail, but, speaking
generally, he found them all exposed to attack, and has
now rendered them impregnable; and since his time
Mesopotamia has become quite protected against the
Persian nation.</p>

<p>Nor must I pass over in silence what he devised at the
fort of Bara, of which I just now spoke. The interior of
this fort was entirely without water, and Bara is built
upon the precipitous summit of a lofty mountain. Outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54"> 54</span>
its walls, at a great distance, at the bottom of the hill,
there was a fountain which it was not thought advisable
to include within the fortification, lest the part which was
situated upon the low ground should be open to attack.
He therefore devised the following plan. He ordered
them to dig within the walls until they reached the level
of the plain. When this was done in accordance with the
Emperor’s order, to their surprise they found the water of
the fountain flowing there; thus the fort was both constructed
securely and conveniently situated with regard
to water supply.</p>

<p>V. In the same manner, since the walls of Theodosiopolis,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
the bulwark of the Roman Empire on the river
Aborrhas, had become so decayed by age that the inhabitants
derived no confidence from their strength, but rather
terror, as they feared that before long they would fall down,
the Emperor rebuilt them for the most part, so that they
were able to check the invasions of the Persians into
Mesopotamia. It is worth describing what he did at
Constantina. The original wall of Constantina was so
low that a ladder would easily reach the top, and in its
construction was greatly exposed to attack, and seemed
hardly to have been built in earnest; for the towers were
of such a distance from one another, that if the assailants
attacked the space between them, the garrison of the
towers would be too far off to drive them back; moreover,
the greater part of it was so ruinous from age that it
seemed likely soon to fall. In addition to this, the city
had an outwork which was more like a siege-work to
enable the enemy to attack it; for it was not more than
three feet in thickness, cemented with mud, the lower
part of it built of rock fit for making mill-stones, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55"> 55</span>
upper part of what is called white-stone, which is not to
be trusted and is very soft, so that the whole work might
easily be captured. However, the Emperor Justinian rebuilt
the decayed part of the walls, more especially on the
west and north sides; between every two towers of the wall
he placed the third, so that since his time all the towers for
the defence of the wall stand close together. He also greatly
raised the height of the wall and of all the towers, so as to
render the place impregnable to an enemy. Moreover, he
built covered approaches to the towers, each of which
towers contained three stories of vaulted stone, so that
each one of them was called and really was a castle in
itself, for what the Greeks call ‘phrourion’ is called a
‘castle’ in the Latin tongue. Besides this, Constantina
used formerly to be reduced to great straits for want of
water; there are indeed wells of good water outside the
walls at the distance of a mile, round which grows a large
wood of very lofty trees; within the walls, however, since
the streets are not built upon level but upon sloping ground,
the city in ancient times was waterless, and its inhabitants
suffered much from thirst and the difficulty of obtaining
water; but the Emperor Justinian brought the water
within the walls by means of an aqueduct, adorned the
city with overflowing fountains, and may justly be termed
its founder. These were the works of the Emperor
Justinian in these cities.</p>

<p>VI. The Romans had a fort by the side of the river
Euphrates on the extreme frontier of Mesopotamia, at the
place where the river Aborrhas<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> effects its junction with
the Euphrates. This fort was named Circesium,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"> 56</span>
been built in former times by the Emperor Diocletian; however,
our present Emperor Justinian, finding that it had become
ruinous through lapse of time, and was neglected and
not in a posture of defence, altered it into a strong fortification,
and made it into a city of eminent size and beauty.
When Diocletian built the fort he did not completely
surround it with a wall, but brought each end of the walls
down to the river Euphrates, built a tower at each end of
them, and left the side between them entirely unfortified,
imagining, I suppose, that the waters of the river would
suffice to defend the fort on that side. In the course of
time, however, the stream of the river, continually eating
away the bank, undermined the tower on the south side,
and it became evident that unless prompt measures were
taken it would shortly fall. Now appeared the Emperor
Justinian, entrusted by Heaven with the glory of watching
over, and, as far as one man can do, of restoring the
Roman Empire. He not only saved the undermined
tower, which he rebuilt of a hard stone, but also enclosed
all the unprotected side of the fort with a very strong
wall, thus doubling its security by adding the strength
which it derived from the wall to that afforded by the
river. Besides this, he also built a powerful outwork
round the city, especially at the spot where the junction
of the two rivers forms a triangular space, and thus left no
place exposed to the attacks of the enemy. Moreover, he
appointed a general who had the title of Duke, and who
always resided there with a garrison of picked soldiers,
thus rendering the place a sufficient bulwark for the
frontier of the empire. He also rebuilt in its present
splendour the public bath which is used by the inhabitants,
which had become quite ruinous and useless by the incursions
of the river; for he found all that part of it which is
suspended above the solid foundation for the convenience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57"> 57</span>
of bathers, underneath which the fire is placed, and which
is called the hypocaust, exposed to the influx of the river,
by which the bath was rendered useless; he therefore
strengthened with stonework, as I have said, the part which
formerly had been hollow, and built another hypocaust
above it, which the river could not reach, thus restoring
the enjoyment of the bath to the garrison. In this manner
did our Emperor restore the buildings of Circesium.</p>

<p>Beyond Circesium there is an ancient fort named Annucas,
whose wall the Emperor Justinian found a mere ruin,
and which he rebuilt in so magnificent a fashion that its
defences vie with those of the most celebrated cities; and
in the same manner he rendered formidable, and altogether
unapproachable by an enemy, those forts situated near the
city of Theodosiopolis, which before his time were either
without walls, or only walled with mud and absurd heaps
of stones. These are Magdalathum, with two others on
either side of it, and the two forts, the Great and Little
Thannurium, Bismideon, Themeres, Bidamas, Dausaron,
Thiolla, Philæ, Zamarthas, and, one may say, all the rest.
There was an extensive position near Thannurium, which
could easily be occupied by our enemies the Saracens, by
crossing the river Aborrhas, from which point they were
able to penetrate in small parties into the thick and
extensive forest and the mountain which is situated in
that region, and make inroads upon the Roman inhabitants
of that country; now, however, the Emperor Justinian
has built a tower of hard stone in that place, manned it
with a considerable garrison, and has altogether repressed
the incursions of the enemy by the establishment of this
bulwark against them.</p>

<p>VII. The above are the works of the Emperor Justinian
in this part of Mesopotamia; I must speak in this place
of Edessa, Carrhæ, Callinicum, and all the other strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58"> 58</span>
places which are in that country, since they lie between
the two rivers. Edessa<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> stands on the banks of a small
stream called Scirtus, which collects its waters from many
places, and runs through the midst of the city: from
thence it passes onwards, after having supplied the wants
of the city, effecting its entrance and exit through by a
channel constructed by former generations, which passes
through the city walls. This river once, after much rain,
rose to a great height, and seemed as though it would
destroy the city; it tore down a large part of the outworks
and of the walls, inundated almost the whole city, and did
much damage, suddenly destroying the finest buildings,
and drowning a third part of the inhabitants. The Emperor
Justinian not only at once restored all the buildings
of the city which were overthrown, among which were the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"> 59</span>
church of the Christians and a building called Antiphorus,
but also arranged with great care that no such disaster
should ever again occur, for he made a new channel for
the river, outside the city walls, which he arranged in
the following manner. The ground on the right bank
of the river was formerly flat and low-lying, while that on
the left was a precipitous mountain, which did not allow
the river to turn aside from its accustomed course, but
forced it to flow into the city, because when flowing
towards the city it met with no obstacle on its right bank.
He therefore dug away the whole of this mountain, making
a channel on the left bank of the river deeper than its
former bed, and built on the right bank an enormous wall
of stones, as large as a waggon could carry, so that if the
river ran as usual with a moderate volume the city would
not be deprived of the convenience of its water; but if it
should be swollen into a flood a moderate stream would
run as usual throughout the city, but the excess of water
would be forced into this channel constructed by Justinian,
and thus extraordinarily conquered by human art and skill
might run round the back of the race-course, which is
situated not far off. Moreover he forced the river within
the city to run in a straight course, by building a wall
above it on either side, so that it could not turn out of a
straight path; by which means he both preserved the use
of it for the city, and removed all fear of it for the future.
The wall and outwork of Edessa, like those of the other
places, had for the most part fallen into ruins through
age; wherefore the Emperor restored them both, making
them new and much stronger than they were before. Part
of the wall of Edessa is occupied by a fort, outside of
which rises a hill very close to the city and overhanging
it; this hill was in ancient times occupied by the inhabitants,
and included in their walls by an outwork, that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60"> 60</span>
might not form a weak point to the city. Their work,
however, made the city much more open to assault in
that quarter; for their outwork was very low, built on
an exposed site, and could be taken even by children
playing at sieges. Justinian therefore took it down and
built another wall on the top of the hill, which is in no
danger of an assault from higher ground in any quarter,
and which follows the slope of the hill down to the level
ground on both sides, and joins the city wall.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

destroyed the walls and outworks, which were much
impaired by age, and rendered them impregnable by
building the present complete fortifications; he also
built a strong wall round the unprotected and neglected
fort at Batnæ,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and gave it the fine appearance which it
now presents.</p>

<p>VIII. These, as I have said before, were the works of
the Emperor Justinian in Mesopotamia and Osrhoene.
I will now describe what was done on the right bank of
the river Euphrates. In all other parts the Roman
and Persian frontiers border upon one another, and each
nation proceeds from its own country to make war and
peace with the other, as all men of different habits and
empires do when they have a common frontier; but in the
province which was formerly called Commagene, which is
now called Euphratesia, they dwell nowhere near to one
another, for the Roman and Persian frontiers are widely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62"> 62</span>
parted by a country which is quite desert and devoid of
life, and possesses nothing worth fighting for. Yet each
nation, though not regarding it as a work of much importance,
has built a chain of forts of unbaked brick where the
desert borders upon their inhabited country. None of these
forts have ever been assaulted by their neighbours, but
the two nations dwell there without any ill-feeling, since
there is nothing for either of them to covet; however, the
Emperor Diocletian built three of these forts in this
desert, one of which, named Mambri, had fallen into ruin
through age, and was restored by the Emperor Justinian.</p>

<p>About five miles from this fort, as you go towards the
Roman country, Zenobia, the wife of Odenathus, the chief
of the Saracens in those parts, built a small city in former
times and gave it her own name, calling it Zenobia.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Since then, long lapse of time brought its walls to ruin,
and as the Romans did not think it worth caring for, it
became entirely uninhabited. Thus the Persians, whenever
they chose, were able to place themselves in the
midst of the Romans before any news had been heard of
their coming; however, the Emperor Justinian rebuilt the
whole of Zenobia, filled it with numerous inhabitants, placed
in it a commander with a garrison of regular soldiers, and
thus formed a powerful fortress, a bulwark of the Roman
Empire and a check upon the Persians. He did not
merely restore it to its former appearance, but made it
far stronger than it was before. The place is closely surrounded
by high cliffs, from which the enemy were formerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63"> 63</span>
able to shoot down upon the heads of the defenders of the
wall; being desirous to avoid this, he constructed a building
upon the walls, on the side nearest these cliffs, which
might always act as a protection to the defenders. This
building is called a ‘wing,’ because it appears to hang
upon the wall. Indeed, it is not possible to describe all
that our Emperor built at Zenobia: for as the city is
situated far away in the desert, and for this reason is
always exposed to peril, and cannot derive any succour
from the Romans, who dwell at a distance, he took the
greatest pains to render it secure. I will now relate some
few of his works there.</p>

<p>Zenobia stands beside the river Euphrates, which flows
close to its walls on the eastern side. This river, surrounded
by high mountains, has no space in which to
extend itself, but its stream is confined among the neighbouring
mountains and between its rugged banks. Whenever
it is swollen by rain into a flood, it pours against the
city wall and washes not merely against its foundations
but as high as its very battlements. The courses of stone
in the walls, drenched by this stream, became disarranged,
and the whole construction was endangered; he, however,
constructed a mole of enormous masses of hard rock, of
the same length as the wall, and forced the flooded river
to expend its rage in vain, setting the wall free from any
fear of injury, however high the river might swell. Finding
that the city wall upon the northern side had become
ruinous from age, he razed it to the ground, together with
its outwork, and rebuilt it, but not upon its former site,
because the houses of the city were so crowded together
at that point as to inconvenience the inhabitants; but he
proceeded beyond the foundations of the wall, beyond the
outwork and the ditch itself, and there built an admirable
and singularly beautiful wall, thus greatly enlarging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64"> 64</span>
Zenobia in this quarter. There was, moreover, a certain
hill which stood near the city towards the west, from
which the barbarians, when they made their attacks, were
able to shoot with impunity down upon the heads of the
defenders, and even of those who were standing in the midst
of the city; this hill the Emperor Justinian surrounded
with a wall on both sides, and thus included it in the city
of Zenobia, afterwards escarping its sides throughout, so
that no enemy could ascend it. He also built another
fort upon the top of the hill, and thus rendered it altogether
inaccessible to those who wished to assault the
city, for beyond the hill the ground sinks into a hollow
valley, and therefore it cannot be closely approached by
the enemy; above this hollow valley the mountains at
once rise on the western side. The Emperor did not
merely watch over the safety of the city, but also built
churches in it, and barracks for the soldiers: he also constructed
public baths and porticos. All this work was
carried out under the superintendence of the architects
Isidorus and Joannes, of whom Joannes was a Byzantine,
and Isidorus a Milesian by birth, being the nephew of that
Isidorus whom I mentioned before. Both of these were
young men, but showed an energy beyond their years, and
both displayed equal zeal in the works which they constructed
for the Emperor.</p>

<p>IX. After Zenobia was the city of Suri,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> situated on the
river Euphrates, whose fortifications were so contemptible
that when Chosroes assaulted it, it did not hold out
for so much as half-an-hour, but was instantly taken
by the Persians. This fort, however, like Callinicum, was
restored by the Emperor Justinian, who surrounded it
with a strong wall, strengthened it with an outwork, and
enabled it for the future to resist the attack of the enemy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"> 65</span>
There is in Euphratesia a church dedicated to Sergius,
an eminent saint, whom the ancients so admired and
looked up to that they named the place Sergiopolis,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and
surrounded it with a low rampart, sufficient to prevent the
Saracens in that region from capturing it by assault; for
the Saracens are by nature incapable of attacking walls,
and consequently the weakest mud wall is sufficient to
resist their onset. In later times this church received so
many offerings as to become powerful and famous throughout
the land. The Emperor Justinian, reflecting upon
these matters, at once applied himself to its protection,
surrounded it with a most admirable wall, and provided a
quantity of water, stored up in reservoirs, for the use of
its inhabitants; besides this, he built in the place houses
and porticos, and all the other buildings which are regarded
as the ornaments of a city. He also placed a
garrison of soldiers in it to defend the walls in time of
need; and, indeed, Chosroes, the King of Persia, who
determined to take the city, and who brought up a large
army to besiege it, was compelled to raise the siege, being
overcome by the strength of the walls.</p>

<p>The Emperor spent equal care upon all the towns and
forts on the borders of Euphratesia, (namely) Barbalissus,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Neocæsarea, Gabula, Pentacomia, which is on the
Euphrates, and Europus.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> At Hemerius, finding the walls
built in some parts carelessly and dangerously, and in some
parts formed only of mud, while the place was deficient in
water-supply and consequently despicable as a fortification,
he razed them to the ground, and at once carefully rebuilt
them of courses of the hardest stone, making the wall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66"> 66</span>
much wider and higher than before. He also constructed
reservoirs for water in all parts of the works, all of which
he filled with rain-water, and, placing a garrison there, he
rendered the place as powerful and secure as we now see
it. Indeed, if one were carefully to consider this, and to
inspect all the other good works of the Emperor Justinian,
one would say it was for this alone that he had received
the crown, by the manifest favour of God, who watches
over the Roman people.</p>

<p>Besides these places he also found Hierapolis,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which is
the chief of all the cities in that region, lying exposed to
any enemy that might attack it, but by his own provident
foresight he rendered it safe; for, as it originally enclosed
a large empty space and on that account the entire circuit
of the walls could not be guarded, he cut off the part
which was useless, arranged the walls in a safer and
more compact form, and, by thus reducing it to the size
necessary for use, made it one of the strongest cities of the
present day. He also conferred upon it the following
benefit. A fountain of sweet water springs perpetually out
of the earth in the midst of the city, and forms therein a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67"> 67</span>
wide lake; this, indeed, added to the safety of the city
when it was beleaguered by an enemy, but in time of peace
was by no means necessary, as much water was brought
into the city from without. In process of time the inhabitants,
having enjoyed a long period of peace, and having
never experienced any distress, neglected this spring; for
it is not in human nature when in prosperity to make
provision against times of adversity; consequently they
gradually filled up the lake with rubbish, and were accustomed
to bathe in it, to wash their clothes in it, and to
throw all kinds of refuse into it....</p>

<p>In this province of Euphratesia were situated two other
towns, Zeugma<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Neocæsarea, which were indeed
towns in name, but were merely surrounded by dry stone
walls, built so low that they might be crossed by an
enemy without any difficulty, since they could leap over
them without fear; while they were so narrow as to be
altogether indefensible, because they afforded no room
for the garrison to stand upon to defend them; however,
the Emperor Justinian surrounded these places also with
real walls, of a sufficient width and height, and equipped
them with all other means of defence, thus giving them
a just right to be termed cities, and rendering them safe
from the attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p>X. Moreover, with regard to the cities taken from
Chosroes, that barbarian, disregarding the perpetual
peace which he had sworn to observe, and the money
which he had received on account of it, was filled with
envy of the Emperor Justinian, because of the conquests
which he had made in Libya and in Italy, and considered
his plighted faith to be of less importance than the gratification
of this passion; he watched his opportunity,
when the greater part of the Roman army was away in the
West, and invaded the Roman territory unexpectedly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68"> 68</span>
before the Romans had any news of the approach of the
enemy; these cities, I say, the Emperor Justinian so
strengthened and beautified that they are all at the
present time much more flourishing than before, and have
no dread of injury from barbarian invasion, fearing no
attacks of any kind.</p>

<p>Above all, he rendered the city of Antiochia,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> which is
now surnamed Theopolis, far more beautiful and powerful
than it was before; its wall in ancient times was too
large, and extended beyond all reason, uselessly enclosing
flat ground in one place, and lofty cliffs in another, so
that it was full of weak points. The Emperor Justinian
reduced it to a useful size, making it protect the city
alone, and not the places which it formerly enclosed. In
the lower part of the fortifications, where the city had
spread out to a dangerous extent over a smooth plain,
and was indefensible through the great length of the wall,
he drew it back as far as possible, advantageously reducing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69"> 69</span>
the size of the city in that quarter, and strengthening it
by concentration. As for the river Orontes, which formerly
flowed past it in a circuitous course, he changed its
direction, and caused it to skirt the walls of the city.
Thus, by an artificial channel, he brought the course of
the river as near the city as possible, by which means he
relieved the city from the danger of its unmanageable
size, and yet retained the protection afforded by the river
Orontes: then, by building new bridges, he supplied fresh
means of intercourse across the river, which he diverted
from its course as far as was required, and then returned
to its former bed.</p>

<p>The upper part of the city, on the high ground, he
fortified in the following manner. On the summit of the
mountain which is called Orocassias there is a lofty rock
which stands close outside the wall opposite to the fortifications
in that quarter, and which renders them easy to
attack. It was from this point that Chosroes took the
city, as I have explained in my work on the subject.
The region within the walls was for the most part
uninhabited and difficult of access, for the place is divided
by lofty rocks and deep ravines, which cut off all the
paths, so that the wall of Antiochia seems there to belong
to another city. He therefore disregarded the rock which
overhangs the wall so close and renders it liable to
capture, and decided to build his new wall at a distance
from it, having learnt by experience the folly of the
original builders; moreover, he levelled the ground within
the walls, which formerly had been precipitous, and made
the ascent to this part of the city not only practicable for
people on foot, but for horsemen and even for carriages.
On this high ground he also built baths and reservoirs for
water within the walls, and dug a well in each tower,
remedying the original waterless character of the place
by the storage of rain-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70"> 70</span></p>

<p>It is worth our while to describe his works upon the
torrent which descends from these mountains. Two
precipitous mountains overhang the city, standing close
to one another; of these, the one is called Orocassias,
the other Stauris. They are joined by a glen and ravine
which lies between them, which in time of rain produces
the torrent named Onopnictes, which used to flow down
from the high ground and overflow the fortifications, and
sometimes rose so high as to pour into the streets of the
city, doing much mischief to the inhabitants. The
Emperor Justinian remedied this in the following manner.
In front of that part of the wall which is nearest to the
ravine, from which the torrent used to rush against the
wall, he built an exceedingly high wall, reaching from
the hollow bed of the ravine to the mountains on either
side, so that the torrent was not able to rush past it, but
was forced to stay and collect its waters there. In this
wall he made apertures, through which he forced the
water to run gently in a smaller volume, checked by this
artificial barrier, so that it no longer broke with its full
force against the city wall so as to overflow it and ruin
the city, but proceeded gently and quietly, as I have
explained, and flowing in this manner passed wherever it
was desired to go through the channels constructed for it
by the former inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thus did the Emperor Justinian reconstruct the walls
of Antiochia; he also rebuilt the entire city, which was
burnt by the enemy. As the whole city was reduced to
ashes, and levelled to the ground, and only heaps of
rubbish remained after the conflagration, it was at first
impossible for the citizens of Antiochia to recognise the
site of their own dwellings. He consequently removed
all the ruins, and cleared away the charred remains of the
houses; but, as there were no public porticos or halls supported
by columns, no market-place, and no streets which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71"> 71</span>
marked out the quarters of the city, there was nothing to
point to the site of any particular house. However, the
Emperor, without any delay, removed the rubbish as far
as possible from the city, thus freeing the air and the
ground from all impediments to building, and first covered
the foundations of the city everywhere with stones large
enough to load a waggon. After this he divided it by
porticos and market-places, defined all the blocks of
building by streets, arranged the aqueducts, fountains, and
watercourses with which the city is adorned, constructed
theatres and public baths in it, and graced it with all the
other public buildings which belong to a prosperous city.</p>

<p>He also brought thither a number of workmen and
artificers, and thus rendered it more easy for the inhabitants
to rebuild their own houses; the result of this is
that Antiochia at the present day is a more celebrated
city than before. He also built therein a large church in
honour of the Virgin, the beauty and magnificence of
which is in all respects beyond description. He endowed
this church with a considerable revenue, and also built a
large church dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel.
Moreover, he made provision for the sick poor in that
place, and built dwellings for them, separate for the
different sexes, in which they were supplied with attendants,
and the means of curing their diseases; while at
the same time he established hospices for strangers who
might be staying for any time in the city.</p>

<p>XI. In like manner he also restored, greatly strengthened,
and brought into its present condition the wall of the city
of Chalcis, together with its outwork, which had become
weak and ruinous through age.</p>

<p>There was in Syria an utterly neglected village named
Cyrus,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which the Jews had built in ancient times when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72"> 72</span>
they were led captive from Palestine into Syria by the
army of the Medes, from which country they were long
afterwards released by Cyrus the King; wherefore they
called the place Cyrus in honour of their benefactor. In
the course of time Cyrus became quite overlooked and
was entirely without walls; but the Emperor Justinian,
with a prudent zeal for the safety of the Empire, and also
out of reverence for the SS. Cosmas and Damianus, whose
bodies lay near that place down to my own time, made
Cyrus into a flourishing and admirable city, rendering it
safe by a very strong wall, with a numerous garrison, large
public buildings, and with all other appurtenances on an exceedingly
magnificent scale. In former times the interior of
this city was without water, but outside the walls was a
plenteous spring which provided abundance of drinking-water,
yet was altogether useless to the inhabitants, since
they had no means of drawing water from it without great
labour and peril; for they were obliged to go to it by a
circuitous path, as the country between it and the city
was precipitous and altogether impassable, so that an
enemy, if he were present, could easily lay an ambush and
cut them off. He therefore constructed a watercourse
from the city walls to the fountain, not open, but concealed
underground with the greatest care, which supplied
the city with water without either trouble or danger.</p>

<p>He also very strongly rebuilt the entire circuit of the
walls of Chalcis,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which had fallen into ruin down to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73"> 73</span>
very foundation and was altogether indefensible, and he
strengthened it with an outwork; he also restored all the
other towns and forts in Syria in an admirable fashion.</p>

<p>Thus did the Emperor Justinian provide for the security
of Syria; there is, too, in Phœnicia, by the side of Lebanon,
a city named Palmyra, which was built in the desert in
ancient times, and which was conveniently placed on the
road by which our enemies the Saracens would enter
our country. It was, indeed, originally built for this purpose;
namely, in order to prevent the barbarians making
unexpected inroads into the Roman territory. This place,
which through lapse of time had become almost entirely
deserted, was strongly fortified by the Emperor Justinian,
who supplied it abundantly with water, and filled it with a
garrison of soldiers, so as to check the inroads of the
Saracens.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_III">BOOK III.</h3>
</div>


<p>I. The Emperor Justinian fortified the eastern country
in the manner which I have described in a former part of
this work. Now as I started from the Persian frontier in
my description of his work upon the fortresses, I think it
will be convenient to proceed from thence to that of
Armenia, which skirts the Persian territory from the city
of Amida as far as that of Theodosiopolis. Before
describing the buildings in that quarter, I think it would
be advisable to give some account of how our Emperor
brought the Armenians out of a condition of danger and
terror into their present state of settled security; for he
did not preserve these his subjects by buildings alone, but
also by his foresight in other matters, as I shall presently
explain. To do this I must refer for a short time to
ancient history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74"> 74</span></p>

<p>In old times the Armenians had a king of their own
nation, as we are told by the historians of remotest antiquity.
When, however, Alexander of Macedon overthrew
the King of Persia, the Persians remained quiet under his
yoke, but the Parthians revolted against the Macedonians,
conquered them in war, drove them out of their country,
and pushed their frontier as far as the river Tigris. Subsequently
the Persians remained subject to them for five
hundred years, up to the time when Alexander, the son of
Mamæa, ruled over the Romans. At this time one of
the kings of the Parthians made his brother, named
Arsaces, King of the Armenians, as the history of the
Armenians tells us; for let no one suppose that the Arsacidæ
are Armenians. Now for five hundred years there
was peace between them in consequence of their relationship.
The King of the Armenians dwelt in what is called
Greater Armenia, having been from ancient times subject
to the Emperor of the Romans; but afterwards one
Arsaces, King of Armenia, had two sons, named Tigranes
and Arsaces. When this King was about to die, he made
a will by which he left the succession to his kingdom to
both his sons, not dividing its power equally between
them, but giving a fourfold greater share to Tigranes.
The elder Arsaces, after making this division of his kingdom,
passed away, but Arsaces his son, grieved and enraged
at the inferiority of his position, laid the matter
before the Roman Empire, hoping that by using all means
in his power he might drive his brother from the kingdom,
and render his father’s unjust wishes of no effect. At this
time Theodosius, the son of Arcadius, ruled over the
Romans, being still a child. Tigranes, fearing the Emperor’s
vengeance, put himself in the hands of the Persians
and handed over his kingdom to them, preferring to live
as a private man amongst the Persians, rather than to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75"> 75</span>
make an equitable arrangement with his brother, and rule
jointly over the Armenians with him in good faith and
honour. Arsaces, being equally afraid of the attacks of
the Persians and of his brother, abdicated his own kingdom
in favour of the Emperor Theodosius, on certain
conditions, which I have explained at length in my History
of the Wars. For some time the country of the Armenians
was an object of contention between the Romans and the
Persians, but they finally agreed that the Persians should
possess the share of Tigranes, and the Romans that of
Arsaces. Both parties signed a treaty on these conditions,
and henceforth the Emperor of the Romans appointed
whom he pleased, and at what time he thought proper, to
rule over the Armenians. This ruler was called the
Count of Armenia down to my own time.</p>

<p>However, since such a kingdom as this was not capable
of repelling the incursions of the enemy, because it
possessed no regular army, the Emperor Justinian, perceiving
that Armenia was always in a disorderly condition,
and therefore was an easy prey to the barbarians, put an end
to this form of government, and placed a general in command
of the Armenians, giving him a sufficient number of
regular soldiers to repel the invasions of the enemy. This
was the arrangement which he adopted for what is called
Greater Armenia; but the remainder of Armenia, that
which reaches from this side of the river Euphrates as
far as the city of Amida, was governed by five Armenian
satraps, whose offices were hereditary and tenable for life;
however, they received the insignia of their office from the
hands of the Roman Emperor alone. It is worth while
to explain what these insignia were, since they will never
again be seen by men: they were a cloak made of wool,
not such as grows on sheep, but such as is gathered from
the sea. The animal on whom this wool grows is called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76"> 76</span>
‘pinna.’ The cloak was of purple, covered with gold at
that part where it was fastened together; there was a gold
brooch upon the cloak, containing a precious stone, from
which three amethysts were suspended by loose golden
chains. The tunic was of silk, entirely covered with the
golden ornaments known as ‘feather-work;’ the boots were
red-coloured, reaching to the knee, such as it is not lawful
for anyone to wear except the Roman Emperors and the
Kings of Persia.</p>

<p>No Roman soldiers were ever employed either by the
King of Armenia or the satraps, but they trusted exclusively
to their own resources in war. In later times,
however, during the reign of the Emperor Zeno, when
Illus and Leontius openly revolted against the Emperor,
certain of the satraps took their side; wherefore the
Emperor Zeno, after his victory over Illus and Leontius,
allowed one of the satraps, whose satrapy—that of the
country called Belabitis—was the weakest and least important,
to retain his former possession, but deposed all
the others, and did not allow these governments any longer
to be held by hereditary descent, but filled them by
persons chosen by the Emperor, as is the custom with all
the other Roman governments. Yet even then Roman
soldiers were not placed in them, but Armenian soldiers,
as had formerly been customary, and who were quite unable
to defend them against the attacks of the enemy.
Perceiving this, the Emperor Justinian abolished the title
of satrap for all time to come, and appointed two rulers
over these nations, with the title of Dukes, giving them a
large number of regular Roman soldiers, in order that with
them they might defend the Roman frontier. He also
built for them strong places, as follows.</p>

<p>II. I shall begin with the country of Mesopotamia, in
order to connect my account with what has been described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77"> 77</span>
above. He established one of these rulers of the Armenian
tribes, who have the title of Duke, in the city which is
called Martyropolis,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the other in a fortress which is
named Citharizon. I will now describe in what part of
the Roman Empire these places are situated. The city
of Martyropolis is situated in that part of Armenia which
is called Sophanene, close to the river Nymphius, and
bordering closely on the enemy’s country; for at that
place the river Nymphius divides the Roman and Persian
territory. Beyond the river lies the country named
Arxanes, which from ancient times has belonged to the
Persians. Yet this city was always neglected by the
Romans, and lay exposed to the attacks of these barbarians;
so that Cabades, the King of the Persians, in
the reign of the Emperor Anastasius, invaded the country
of the Romans, and led an army through Martyropolis,
which is distant from Amida a little more than a day’s
journey for a lightly equipped traveller. As a mere incident
and unimportant part of his invasion he took this
city without any siege, assault, or beleaguerment, but
simply by giving out that he was coming; for the inhabitants,
who knew well that they could not hold out for a
single moment of time against his army, as soon as they
saw the Median host near at hand, at once went over to
Cabades, with Theodorus—who at that time was satrap of
Sophanene—at their head, dressed in the insignia of his
office, and delivered themselves and the city of Martyropolis
up to him, taking with them the public revenue for
two years. Cabades, pleased with this, refrained from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78"> 78</span>
ravaging the city and the entire country, which he regarded
as part of the Persian Empire. He dismissed the
people unhurt, and neither did any injury to them nor
altered anything in their city, but replaced Theodorus—whom
he regarded as a wise man—as satrap over them,
placing in his hands the symbols of authority, and trusting
him to protect the Persian territory. After this he led his
army onwards, took Amida by a siege, and retired into the
Persian territory, as I have described in my ‘History of
the Wars.’ The Emperor Anastasius, perceiving that it
was not possible for the city of Martyropolis to defend
itself without any fortifications against the attacks of the
enemy, not only was not angry with Theodorus and the
people of Sophanene, but declared that he was very thankful
to them for their action. The wall of the city of
Martyropolis was in thickness about four feet, and in
height about twenty feet; so that it could not only be
easily captured by an enemy, who employed siege operations
and brought battering engines against it, but could
easily be escaladed.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, the Emperor Justinian proceeded
as follows. He dug a trench outside the walls,
laid foundations in it, and built a new wall of a thickness
of four feet, at a distance of four feet from the old wall.
He raised this wall also to a height of twenty feet,
making it in all respects equal in size to the old one; he
then filled up the space between the two walls with
stones and mortar, thus forming the whole work into one
wall twelve feet in thickness. He then raised it, keeping
the thickness the same, to a height twice as great as that
which it formerly possessed; moreover, he built an
admirable outwork round the city, and built all the other
defences of a fortified place.</p>

<p>III. On the west side of Martyropolis is a place named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79"> 79</span>
Phison, which also is situated in that part of Armenia
which is called Sophanene, and is distant from Martyropolis
a little more than one day’s journey. About eight
miles beyond this place lie precipitous and altogether
impassable mountains, between which are two narrow
passes, situated close to one another, which are called
Clisuræ. Travellers from Persian Armenia to Sophanene,
whether they proceed from the Persian territory or by
way of the fortress of Citharizon, must necessarily proceed
through these two passes, of which the one is called by
the natives Illyrisis, and the other Saphchæ. Each of
these ought to be fortified with the utmost care, in
order to bar the way against the enemy; in former times,
however, they remained entirely unguarded. But the
Emperor Justinian, by placing admirable fortifications
both at Phison and in the passes, and by establishing
sufficient garrisons in them, rendered it altogether impossible
for the barbarians to invade the country. These
were the works of the Emperor Justinian in that part of
the country of Armenia which is called Sophanene.</p>

<p>In Citharizon, which is in the province called Asthianene,
he built a new fort on a hilly spot, of great size,
and completely impregnable. This place he furnished
with a sufficient supply of water, and all other conveniences
for its inhabitants, and placed in command of it, as
I said before, the other Duke of Armenia with a sufficient
garrison of soldiers, thus rendering the tribes of Armenia
secure in this quarter also.</p>

<p>As one goes from Citharizon<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> towards Theodosiopolis
and Greater Armenia is the country of Corzane, which extends
for a distance of about three days’ journey, without
any lake, river or mountain to divide it from the country of
the Persians, whose frontier is confused with it; so that
the inhabitants of this region, whether they be Roman or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80"> 80</span>
Persian subjects, have no fear of one another, and never
expect any attack, but intermarry with one another, have
common markets for their produce, and cultivate the
country together. When the rulers of either nation
make an expedition against the other at the command of
their prince, they always find their neighbours unprotected;
for each of them has extremely populous places
close to one another, while in former times there was no
fortification whatever; so that it was possible for the King
of Persia to invade the Roman territory in this quarter more
easily than anywhere else, until the Emperor Justinian
prevented his doing so, in the following manner. In the
midst of this country there was a place named Artaleson,
which he surrounded with a very strong wall, and made
into an impregnable fortress; he placed a garrison of
regular soldiers in it, and appointed a general over them,
whom the Romans in the Latin language style ‘a Duke.’
Thus did he fortify the whole of that frontier.</p>

<p>IV. These were the works of the Emperor Justinian in
that quarter. I now come to what he did in the rest of
Armenia. The city of Satala was formerly in a perilous
position, because it is not far distant from the enemy’s
country, and is built upon low ground, surrounded by
many hills, so that it ought in consequence of its position
to possess impregnable fortifications. However, its defences
were even more untrustworthy than its position, the
works having been badly and carelessly constructed, and
by lapse of time having fallen into ruin. The whole of
these were demolished by the Emperor, who built a new
wall round it of sufficient height to appear to overtop the
neighbouring hills, and of sufficient thickness to support
such an unusual height with safety. He built round it an
outwork of an admirable character, and struck despair
into the heart of the enemy. He also built a very strong
fort not far from Satala, in the province of Osrhoene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81"> 81</span></p>

<p>In this province there was an old fort built by the
ancients upon the ridge of a precipitous hill, which was
once taken by Pompeius, the Roman general, who, when
he became master of the country, fortified it with great
care, and named it Colonia. The Emperor Justinian
exerted all his power in restoring this fort, which had
fallen into decay after so long a time; moreover, he distributed
enormous sums of money among the inhabitants
of this region, and thus persuaded them to build new
fortifications on their own ground, and to restore those
which had fallen into ruin; so that nearly all the works
situated in that country were built by the Emperor Justinian.
There also he built the forts of Baiberdon and
Arcon; he restored Lysiormum and Lutararizon;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> he also
built a new fort in the place which is called the Ditch of
Germanus. Moreover, he restored the walls of Sebastia<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and Nicopolis, which are cities of Armenia, which were on
the point of falling, having become decayed through age.
In them he built churches and monasteries. At Theodosiopolis
he built a church dedicated to the Virgin, and
restored the monasteries in the places named Petrius and
Cucarizon. At Nicopolis<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> he built the monastery of the
Forty-five saints, and a church of St. George the Martyr
at Bizana. Near Theodosiopolis he restored the monastery
named after the Forty Martyrs.</p>

<p>There was a place in what used to be called Lesser
Armenia, not far from the river Euphrates, where formerly
a regiment of Roman soldiers was stationed. The place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82"> 82</span>
was named Melitene, and the regiment was named Legion.
Here the Romans in former times had built a square
fortification on low ground, which was convenient for
soldiers’ quarters and for the reception of their standards.
Afterwards, by the orders of Trajan, the Roman Emperor,
the place was raised to the dignity of a city, and became
the capital of that nation. In the course of time the city
of Melitene became large and populous; and since it was
no longer possible for the inhabitants to dwell within the
fortification, which, as I have said, enclosed but a small
space of ground, they built their city in the plain near it,
erecting thereon their churches, the dwellings of their
magistrates, the market-place, and the shops of their
merchants, the streets, porticos, baths, theatres, and all
the other ornaments of a large city. In this manner
Melitene became for the most part composed of suburbs.
The Emperor Anastasius attempted to enclose the whole
of it with a wall, but died before he had carried out his
intention; however, the Emperor Justinian built a wall
all round it, and rendered Melitene<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> a great defence and
ornament to the Armenians.</p>

<p>V. These are the works of our Emperor in that part of
Armenia which lies on the right bank of the Euphrates;
I will now speak of what he did in Greater Armenia.
When the Roman Emperor Theodosius obtained the
kingdom of Arsaces, as I explained before, he built a
castle on one of its hills, very liable to capture, which he
called Theodosiopolis. This was taken by Cabades, the
king of Persia, when he passed it as he was marching
straight upon Amida. Not long afterwards the Roman
Emperor Anastasius built a city there, enclosing within
its walls the hill upon which Theodosius had placed his
castle. Although he named the city after himself, yet he
was not able to abolish the name of Theodosius, its former
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83"> 83</span>
founder; for though the things in common use among
mankind are constantly changing, yet it is not easy to
alter their former names. The wall of Theodosiopolis was
of a sufficient width, but was not raised to a proportional
height, for it was only about thirty feet high, and therefore
was very liable to capture by an enemy skilled in sieges,
such as the Persians. It was weak in other respects also,
for it was not defended by any outwork or ditch; moreover,
some high ground close to the city overhung the
wall. These defects the Emperor Justinian remedied in
the following manner; in the first place he dug a very
deep trench all round it, like the bed of a torrent among
precipitous mountains: next, he cut up the overhanging
hill into a mass of inaccessible precipices and pathless
ravines; moreover, in order to make the wall very high,
and unassailable by an enemy, he employed the same
device as at the city of Dara. He contracted the battlements
to the smallest size through which it was possible
to shoot at the besiegers, laid stones over them so as to
make another story round the entire circuit, and skilfully
placed a second set of battlements upon it, enclosing the
whole place within an outwork like that of the city of
Dara, and making each tower into a strong castle. He
established in this place all the forces of Armenia, with
their general, and rendered the Armenians so strong that
they no longer feared the attacks of the Persians.</p>

<p>At Bizana the Emperor did nothing of this sort; for this
place is situated upon flat country, surrounded by wide
plains fit for the manœuvres of cavalry, and full of putrid
pools of stagnant water; so that it was very easily stormed
by an enemy, and was very unhealthy for its inhabitants;
for these reasons, he neglected this place, and built a
city elsewhere to which he gave his own name. It is a
fine city and altogether impregnable, and stands in a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84"> 84</span>
called Tzumina, distant three miles from Bizana, in a very
healthy and airy position on high ground.</p>

<p>VI. These were the acts of the Emperor Justinian in
Armenia. At this point of my narrative it appears convenient
to describe what he did among the tribes of the
Tzani, since they dwell next to the Armenians. In ancient
times the Tzani were independent and without any rulers,
living after the manner of wild beasts, regarding and worshipping
as gods the woods and birds and other animals.
They spent all their lives in lofty and thickly wooded
mountains, and never cultivated the ground, but supported
themselves by plundering and brigandage; for they themselves
were unacquainted with agriculture, and their
country, when it is not covered with precipitous mountains,
is hilly: and the surface of these hills is not earthy,
or capable of growing crops even if it were cultivated, but
rough and hard, and altogether sterile. It is not possible
to irrigate the ground, to reap a crop, or to find a meadow
anywhere; and even the trees, with which the land of the
Tzani is covered, bear no fruit, because for the most part
there is no regular succession of seasons, and the land is
not at one time subjected to cold and wet, and at another
made fertile by the warmth of the sun, but is desolated by
perpetual winter and covered by eternal snows. For this
reason the Tzani, in ancient times, remained independent;
but during the reign of our Emperor Justinian they were
conquered by the Romans, under the command of Tzita;
and, perceiving that resistance was impossible, at once
submitted in a body, preferring an easy servitude to a
dangerous freedom. They at once all changed their religion
to the true faith, became Christians, and embraced
a more civilized mode of life, renouncing brigandage, and
serving in the Roman army, which was constantly at war
with their enemies. However, the Emperor Justinian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"> 85</span>
fearing that the Tzani might at some time revert to their
former wild mode of life, devised the following expedients.</p>

<p>The whole country of the Tzani is difficult, and quite
impassable for horsemen, being everywhere surrounded
with precipices and woods, as I said before; so that
it was impossible for the Tzani to mix with their neighbours,
but they lived by themselves in a savage manner,
like wild beasts. He therefore cut down all the trees
which hindered the making of roads, and levelled the
rough ground, rendering it easily passable for horsemen,
and thus made it possible for them to mix with the rest
of mankind, and hold intercourse with their neighbours.
Next he built a church for them in a place called Schamalinichon,
in order that they might perform divine service,
partake of the holy mysteries, gain the favour of God by
prayers, perform the other duties of religion, and feel
themselves to be human beings. He built forts in every
part of the country, garrisoned them with regular Roman
soldiers, and thus enabled the Tzani to mix without restraint
with the rest of mankind. I shall now describe
the parts of Tzania in which he built these forts.</p>

<p>There is there a place where the three frontiers of
the Roman Empire, of Persian Armenia, and of the Tzani
join; here he constructed a new and very powerful fort,
named Oronon, which he made the chief guarantee of
peace to the country; for at that point the Romans first
entered Tzania. Here he established a garrison under a
general with the title of Duke. At a place distant two
days’ journey from Oronon, on the frontier of the Ocenite
Tzani—for the Tzani are divided into many tribes—there
was a fortress built in ancient times, which long before
this had fallen into ruin by neglect, and was named
Charton. The Emperor Justinian restored this, and
placed in it a large garrison to keep the province in order.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86"> 86</span>
On the east of this place is a precipitous ravine stretching
towards the north. Here he built a new fort named
Barchon. Beyond this, at the skirts of the mountain, are
stables where the Ocenite Tzani used to keep their cattle,
not in order to plough the land,—for the Tzani, as I said
before, are altogether idle, and know nothing of husbandry,
and have no ploughed land, or other operations of farming,—but
for a constant supply of milk and meat. Beyond
the skirts of the mountain, to the westward of the place
upon the plain, which is called Cena, stands the fort of
Sisilisson, which was of ancient construction, but by
length of time had fallen into ruin, and was restored by
the Emperor Justinian, who established in it, as in all
the others, a sufficient garrison of Roman soldiers. On
the left, as one goes from thence in a northerly direction,
is a place which the natives call the Ditch of Longinus;
for in ancient times Longinus, a Roman general of the
Isaurian nation, pitched his camp there during a campaign
against the Tzani. Here our Emperor built a fort, named
Burgum Noes, a day’s journey distant from Sisilisson,
which, like the fort at Sisilisson described above, our
Emperor very strongly fortified. Beyond this is the frontier
of the Coxylini Tzani, where he placed two forts
named Schimalinichon and Tzanzakon. Here he placed
another officer with a garrison.</p>

<p>VII. These were the works of the Emperor Justinian
among the Tzani. In the country beyond them, on the
banks of the Euxine Sea, is a city called Trapezus.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As
there was a scarcity of water at this place, the Emperor
Justinian constructed an aqueduct, called by the name of
the Martyr Eugenius, by which he relieved the wants of
the inhabitants. Both here and at Amasea<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> he restored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"> 87</span>
the greater part of the churches, which had become
ruinous by lapse of time. Beyond the frontier of the city
of Trapezus is a place named Rhizeum,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> which he in
person restored and surrounded with fortifications magnificent
beyond description and belief; for the city is second
to none of those on the Persian frontier in size and
strength.</p>

<p>He also built a fort in Lazica, named Losorium, and
fortified the passes in that country, which are named
the Clisuræ, in order to shut out the enemy from the
country of the Lazi.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> He also restored an ancient and
ruinous church of the Christian Lazi, and founded a noble
city, named Petra,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which the Lazi by their own negligence
allowed to fall into the hands of the Persians, when Chosroes
came thither with a great army; but the Romans
conquered the Persians in battle, killed some of them,
took the rest prisoners, and razed the city to the ground,
that the Persians might not be able to return thither and
do any more mischief—all of which has been described in
my ‘History of the Wars’—where also is a description of
how, on the Continent opposite the territory of the Lazi,
as one goes towards the Mæotic Lake,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the Romans destroyed
two forts, named Sebastopolis<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and Pityous, because
they heard that Chosroes meditated sending an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88"> 88</span>
army to occupy them. Now, however, the Emperor
Justinian entirely rebuilt Sebastopolis, which before was
only a small fort, making it impregnable by the strength
of its walls and other defences, and ornamenting it with
streets and buildings, so as to render it one of the first of
cities, both for size and beauty.</p>

<p>Moreover, finding that the walls of the cities of Bosporus
and Cherson, which are situated upon the sea-shore in
that region, beyond the Mæotic Lake and the Tauri and
the Tauroscythi, on the frontier of the Roman Empire,
had quite fallen into ruin, he restored them to a condition
of great beauty and strength. In the same region he
built the fort of Alustus, and one in the country of the
Gorzubiti. He especially strengthened the fortifications
of Bosporus, which, in ancient times, had fallen into the
power of the barbarians, and which he captured from the
Huns and annexed to the Roman Empire. There is here
a country by the sea-shore, named Doru, which has been
long inhabited by those Goths, who would not follow
Theoderic on his expedition to Italy, but of their own
accord remained there, and have been in alliance with the
Romans down to my own time, joining the Roman
armies when they march against the enemy, at the pleasure
of the Emperor; their numbers are about three
thousand; they are excellent warriors, industrious husbandmen,
and most hospitable to strangers. Their country,
Doru, is situated on high ground, yet is not rough or
sterile, but good soil, producing the best of crops. The
Emperor built no city or fort anywhere in this country, as
its inhabitants cannot endure to be confined within walls,
but love to dwell in the open country. He did, however,
fortify with long walls the passes by which an enemy could
enter the country, and thus freed the Goths from foreign
invasion. These were his works in this quarter.</p>

<p>There is a maritime town of the Thracians on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89"> 89</span>
borders of the Euxine Sea, named Anchialus,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which it
would be more proper to mention in my description of
Thrace; since, however, the course of my narrative has
led me to speak of the works of our Emperor on the
shores of the Euxine Sea, it will be well at this point to
describe the buildings which he erected at Anchialus. At
this place, fountains of warm water, which spring up not
far from the city, supply the inhabitants with natural
baths. This place was neglected and left unfortified by
the former Emperors, although so many tribes of barbarians
dwell in the neighbourhood of it, so that the sick
persons, who resorted to it, could not enjoy its benefits
without considerable danger; however, the Emperor Justinian
has now fortified it, and enabled them to be healed
in safety. These were the fortifications built in the East,
in Armenia, in the country of the Tzani, and on the
shores of the Euxine Sea, by the Emperor Justinian. Let
us now proceed from this region to the buildings which
he has constructed in the rest of Europe.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_IV">BOOK IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>I. I count it a toilsome and perilous task, to cross a great
ocean in a crazy vessel; and it is the same thing to
describe the buildings of the Emperor Justinian in a feeble
narrative; for this Emperor, one may say, showed greatness
of mind in all that he did, and in his buildings performed
works surpassing description. In Europe especially,
wishing to construct works on a scale worthy of the need
which existed for them, his buildings are difficult, nay,
almost impossible to describe, being worthy of their
position in the neighbourhood of the river Danube and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90"> 90</span>
the barbarian tribes beyond it, whose invasions they are
intended to repel; for along its banks dwell the nations of
the Huns and the Goths, and the empire is threatened by
the tribes of the Tauri and the Scythians, the Sclavonians
and the rest, whom the ancient historians call the ‘dwellers
in waggons’ or Sauromatæ, and all the other wild tribes
which either inhabit or roam through that region. With all
these tribes, ever eager for war, Justinian was forced to
contend, so that he could neglect no point, but was forced
to construct a chain of innumerable fortresses, establish in
them numberless garrisons of soldiers, and do everything
else in his power to hold in check a foe, with whom
neither truce nor intercourse could be held; for these
enemies were accustomed to make war without any pretext
or declaration, and not to terminate it by any treaty,
or cease fighting after a time, but to take up arms without
any cause only to lay them down when compelled by
main force. However, let us proceed to what remains of
our description; for when a work is begun, it is better to
bring it to an end in any fashion whatever, rather than to
give it up and leave it unfinished; besides which, we
might reasonably be blamed if our Emperor could construct
such works, and we were to shrink from the labour
of describing them. Now that I am about to enumerate
the buildings of this our Emperor in Europe, it is worth
while before doing so to make a few remarks about the
country.</p>

<p>From what is called the Adriatic Sea a branch extends
straight into the continent, apart from the rest of the sea,
so as to divide the country and form the Ionian Gulf,
having on its right bank the Epirotes and the other
nations in that quarter, and on the left the Calabrians.
Compressed into a long and narrow inlet, it embraces
almost the whole of the continent. Above this sea and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91"> 91</span>
running over against it, the river Danube forms the land
of Europe into a peninsula. Here our Emperor constructed
many admirable works; for he fortified the whole
of Europe so securely as to render it inaccessible to the
barbarians who dwell beyond the river Danube.</p>

<p>I ought, however, to begin with the native country of
the Emperor, which must occupy the first place in my
narrative, as it does in all other respects; for it alone may
rejoice and pride itself upon the glory of having bred and
furnished the Romans with an Emperor, whose works are
so great that they can neither be described in language nor
set down in writing.</p>

<p>In the country of the European Dardani, who dwell
beyond the frontier of the citizens of Epidamnus, near
the fort called Bederiana, is a place named Tauresium,
from whence came the Emperor Justinian, the Founder
of the Universe.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This place he hastily fortified in a
quadrangular form, placing a tower at each angle, and
gave it from its shape the name of Tetrapyrgia, or the
‘Four Towers.’ Close to this place he built a most noble
city, which he named Justiniana Prima (this word in the
Latin language means ‘First’), thus repaying his debt to
the country which bred him, though this duty ought to
have been shared by all the Romans, since this place furnished
a preserver for them all alike. Here he constructed
an aqueduct and supplied the city with a perpetual flow
of water, and erected many other works, magnificent and
surpassing all description, worthy of the founder of the
city; it is not easy to enumerate the churches, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92"> 92</span>
impossible for language to describe the dwellings of the
magistrates, the size of the porticos, the beauty of the
market-places, the fountains, the streets, the baths, and
the shops. In a word, the city is great, populous,
flourishing, and worthy to be the metropolis of the whole
country, to which dignity it has been raised. In addition
to this, it is the seat of the Archbishop of Illyria, all the
other cities yielding to it as being the greatest in size; so
that it in turn reflects glory upon the Emperor; for the
city prides itself upon the Emperor which it has bred,
while the Emperor glories in having constructed the city.
Let the above description of it suffice; for to describe it
all, in exact detail, is impossible, because all language
must fall short of a city worthy of such an Emperor.</p>

<p>Besides this, he entirely rebuilt the fort of Bederiana,
and rendered it much stronger than before. There was
an ancient city in the country of the Dardani, named
Ulpiana. He demolished the greater part of the wall of
this place, which was very unsafe and altogether useless,
and brought it to its present magnificent appearance,
decorated it with many other beautiful buildings, and
gave it the name of Justiniana Secunda. (Secunda in the
Latin language signifies ‘Second.’) He also built a new
city in its neighbourhood, which he named Justinopolis,
after the name of his uncle Justin. He restored the walls
of Sardica, Naïsopolis, Germana and Pantalia, which he
found dilapidated by age, so as to make them secure and
impregnable. Between these cities he built three small
towns, Cratiscara, Quimedaba, and Rumisiana. Thus he
restored these cities from their foundations; and, wishing
to render the river Danube a very strong bulwark to them
and to the whole of Europe, he covered the whole course
of the river with numerous forts, as I shall shortly afterwards
describe, and established on all parts of its banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93"> 93</span>
garrisons of soldiers, sufficient to restrain the barbarians
from crossing the river in that quarter. When, however,
he had completed all these works, remembering the insecurity
of all human designs, and reflecting that, should
the enemy succeed in passing the river by any means,
they would ravage the unguarded country, carry off all the
inhabitants for slaves, and plunder all their property, he
did not leave them to trust to the forts along the course
of the river alone for their protection, but gave them
means of defence of their own; for he constructed such
a number of fortifications in these regions, that every
field either possesses a castle or is near to some walled
place, both here and in New and Old Epirus. Here also
he built the city of Justinianopolis, which formerly was
called Adrianopolis.</p>

<p>He restored Nicopolis, Photica and Phœnice; the latter
towns, Photica and Phœnice, being situated upon low
ground, suffered from inundations; wherefore the Emperor
Justinian, perceiving that it was impossible to build walls for
them upon a firm foundation, made no alteration in either
of them, but built forts near them, which he placed upon
strong and precipitous ground. In this country there was
an ancient city, abundantly supplied with water, and deriving
its name from its position, for it was formerly named
Eurœa. Not far from this city of Eurœa is a lake, in the
midst of which rises an island containing a hill; the lake
reaches round this island so far as only just to allow access
to it. The Emperor transferred the inhabitants of Eurœa
to this place, built a city for them, and strongly fortified
it.</p>

<p>II. After our survey of the whole of Epirus we pass
over Ætolia and Acarnania, and come to the Crissæan
Gulf, the Isthmus of Corinth, and the other parts of
Greece. Here the Emperor’s foresight was most especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94"> 94</span>
displayed, and one may marvel at the numerous walled
cities with which he fortified the Roman Empire. Amongst
the rest he paid especial care at the pass of Thermopylæ.
In the first place he raised its walls to a great height, for
the mountains in this place were easy to be taken by an
enemy, and were fortified by what was more like a hedgerow
than a wall. He placed double battlements upon all
these walls, and also upon the fort, which had been built
there in an equally careless manner by the ancients, giving
it a sufficient height, and double bulwarks. Besides all
this, as the place was entirely without water, he contrived
a reservoir for rain-water, and also carefully fortified
many paths up the mountain which had formerly been
left unguarded.</p>

<p>One may well wonder how the Persian King spent so
long a time here, and only found one path, and that, too,
one which was betrayed to him by Greek traitors, when
there are many unfortified roads in the place along which
one could almost drive a waggon; for the sea, which
washes the base of the mountains, has widened the mouths
of most of the paths leading up from thence, and as the
ground was full of glens and impassable ravines, it appeared
to the ancients that what was thus divided by nature
could not be continuously enclosed by fortifications, so
that they lazily sacrificed their safety in their reluctance to
embark upon so difficult a work, and trusted to chance,
resting all their hopes of safety against the invasion of the
barbarians on their probable ignorance of the roads; for
men who despair of accomplishing difficult tasks always
imagine that what they have found so hard, will not easily
be effected by others; so that it cannot be disputed that
the Emperor Justinian showed greater care and foresight
than anyone else who has ever lived, since he was not
prevented, even by the sea which washes and breaks upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95"> 95</span>
these mountains, from laying firm foundations on the very
beach and watery shore, and making the most contrary
elements serve his purpose, and yield to him, subdued by
human art. However, not even after having connected
these mountain thickets and glens, and having joined the
sea to the mountain, and enclosed the whole of Greece
with his fortifications, did our Emperor relax his zeal on
behalf of his subjects, but he also built many forts within
this wall, taking a just view of the chances of human life,
which render no place secure or impregnable; so that if
by any mischance it should happen that these walls should
at any time be taken, the garrison might find a refuge in
these forts. Moreover, he established everywhere granaries
and reservoirs of water in secure positions, and placed
nearly 2,000 soldiers to garrison the works, which was
never done by any emperor at any former time; for these
walls remained unguarded formerly, even down to my own
time, and if the enemy assaulted them, some of the peasants
in the neighbourhood, adopting a military life on the spur
of the moment, used to act as garrison, and, from their
want of experience, risked the capture of them and of
the whole of Greece, by which parsimony this country
was for a long time exposed to the attack of the barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Thus did the Emperor Justinian strengthen the fortifications
of Thermopylæ. He also with great care built
walls round the cities which lie in the country beyond
it—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96"> 96</span>Saccus, Hypata, Coracii, Unnum, Baleæ and Leontarium.
At Heraclea he did as follows: as one goes from Illyria to
Greece, two mountains stand close to one another for a
long distance, forming a narrow pass between them, of the
kind called Clisuræ. In the midst runs a fountain, which
in the summer-time pours a clear and drinkable stream
down from the mountains which stand around, and forms
a tiny rivulet; but in rainy seasons there rises a very deep
and violent torrent, which collects its waters from the
ravines among the cliffs. By this path the barbarians
were able to gain an easy passage to Thermopylæ and the
neighbouring parts of Greece. On either side of the path
there were in ancient times two ancient fortresses, one
being the city of Heraclea, which I mentioned before, and
the other that of Myropole, standing at a little distance
from it. The Emperor Justinian restored both these
fortresses, which had long been in ruins, and built a very
strong wall across the pass, joining it to the mountains on
either side, so that he closed the passage against the barbarians,
and forced the torrent first to form a lake within
this wall, and then to flow over it and continue its course.</p>

<p>He secured all the cities of Greece which lie within the
walls of Thermopylæ, restoring the fortifications of all of
them, for they had long ago fallen into decay—at Corinth
in consequence of violent earthquakes, and at Athens,
Platæa, and the towns in Bœotia having fallen into decay
through age, as no one had taken any care of them; he,
however, left no place assailable or unguarded, for in his
watchful care for his subjects he bethought him that the
barbarians, should they reach the country about Thermopylæ,
would despair of success as soon as they learned
that they would gain nothing by forcing the works there,
since all the rest of Greece was fortified, and they would
have to undertake the siege of each individual city; for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97"> 97</span>
deferred hope does not encourage men to endure labour,
nor are they eager for gain which is far distant, but give
up their hopes of future advantage to avoid present discomfort.</p>

<p>Having effected this, the Emperor Justinian, learning
that all the cities in Peloponnesus were unwalled, and
reflecting that much time would be wasted if he attended
to the security of each one, securely fortified the whole
isthmus with a wall, since the existing wall was mostly in
ruins. Upon this wall he built forts and established garrisons
in them, and in this manner rendered the whole
country of Peloponnesus safe from the enemy, even
though any misfortune should befall the fortifications at
Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>III. Diocletianopolis in Thessaly was in ancient times
a flourishing city, but latterly was ruined by the incursions
of the barbarians, and had long been without inhabitants.
There is a lake near it, which is called Castoria, in the
midst of which is an island surrounded by water, with
only one narrow passage, not wider than fifteen feet,
leading to it through the lake. On this island stands a
very lofty mountain, which overhangs the lake on one side
and the island on the other; wherefore our Emperor decided
against the site of Diocletianopolis, because it was
obviously exposed to attack, and had long before suffered
the misfortunes which I had mentioned, but built a very
strong city on the island, to which he naturally gave his
own name. Besides this, he removed the walls of Echinæum,
Thebes, Pharsalus, and all the other cities of
Thessaly, amongst which are Demetrias, Metropolis,
Gomphi, and Tricattus, and securely fortified them, for
their walls were decayed by age and could easily be taken
by an enemy.</p>

<p>Now that we have come to Thessaly, let us proceed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98"> 98</span>
Mount Pelion and the river Peneus. The Peneus flows in
a gentle stream past Mount Pelion, and in its course
adorns the city of Larissa, for Phthia no longer exists,
but has perished through age. The river flows with a
quiet stream as far as the sea, and the neighbouring
country is rich in fruits of all kinds, and in sweet waters,
which the inhabitants were never able to enjoy, as they
were in continual expectation of an attack from the barbarians;
for there was no strong place anywhere in these
regions to which they could fly for refuge, but the walls
of Larissa and Cæsarea were so ruinous that they were
almost open towns. The Emperor Justinian, by rebuilding
the walls of both these cities very strongly, enabled the
country to enjoy true prosperity. Not far from hence rise
precipitous mountains covered with lofty trees. These
mountains were the home of the Centaurs; and in this
country the battle of the Centaurs with the Lapithæ took
place, as the ancient myths declare, which inform us that
in old times there dwelt there a monstrous race combining
the forms of two creatures. Antiquity gives some warrant
for this fable by the name of a fort in these mountains,
which down to my own time was named Centauropolis,
whose ruinous walls the Emperor Justinian restored and
strengthened, together with those of Eurymene in the
same country, which had fallen into the same condition.</p>

<p>Now, that I may leave no part of Greece undescribed,
we must proceed to the island of Eubœa, which stands
close to Athens and Marathon. This island of Eubœa
lies in the sea, in front of Greece, and seems to me as
though it had once formed a part of the mainland, and
had afterwards been separated from it by a strait, for an
arm of the sea flows past the mainland there, in the
neighbourhood of the city of Chalcis, ebbing and flowing
in a narrow channel, confined between banks which re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99"> 99</span>duce
it to the size of a rivulet. This strait is called the
Euripus. Such is the island of Eubœa. A single beam
laid across the strait forms a bridge, which the inhabitants
lay across at their pleasure, and then appear to be dwellers
on the continent, and walk on foot to the land beyond the
strait; but when they remove it, they cross the strait in
boats, and again become islanders: so that whether they
proceed on foot or on shipboard depends upon the laying
down or taking up of a single piece of wood....</p>

<p>The country within this is named (the Peninsula of) Pallene.
In ancient times the inhabitants built a wall across
the isthmus, which joined the sea at each end, and built
there a city, which in former times was called Potidæa, and
now Casandria; however, time so ruined all these buildings
that when, not long ago, the Huns overran these regions,
they captured this cross-wall and city as though in sport,
though they never have conducted a siege since the world
began. This event, however, gave the Emperor Justinian
an opportunity of displaying his goodness and magnanimity:
for as he was always wont to repair all the misfortunes
which befell him by his own foresight, he turned the
most terrible disasters into a source of good fortune by
the magnificent works by which he repaired. So here he
fortified the city of Pallene, which is the bulwark of the
whole country, and the wall across the isthmus, so as to
render them quite impregnable and able to defy all attacks.
These were his works in Macedonia.</p>

<p>Not far from the city of Thessalonica flows the river
Rhechius, which passes through a fertile and rich country,
and empties itself into the sea at that place. This river
flows with a gentle current: its waters are calm and
sweet. The neighbouring country is low-lying, well-watered,
and forms rich pasture; but was sadly exposed
to the inroads of the barbarians, having no fort or place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100"> 100</span>
of strength of any kind for a distance of forty miles;
wherefore the Emperor built a strong fort on the banks of
the river Rhechius where it joins the sea—an entirely new
work, to which he gave the name of Artemisium.</p>

<p>IV. It is my duty to mention the other strong places in
this part of Europe. I am quite sure that if I were to
recount this list of the fortresses in this country, to men
dwelling in a distant region and belonging to another
nation, without any facts to guarantee the truth of my
story, the number of the works would make it appear altogether
fabulous and incredible; as it is, however, they are
to be seen at no great distance, and great numbers of the
inhabitants of that region are present in our city; wherefore,
with the confidence which springs from truth, I shall
not hesitate to give a list of the works of the Emperor
Justinian in the above-mentioned countries, both in
restoring ruinous fortifications and in building new ones.
It will be most convenient to put them all in the form of
a list, so that my narrative may not be confused by the
insertion of their names.</p>

<p>These are the new forts built by the Emperor Justinian
in New Epirus:<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>V. Thus did the Emperor Justinian fortify the whole
Illyrian continent. I shall now set forth the manner in
which he strengthened the bank of the river Ister, which
men also call the Danube, with fortifications and garrisons
of soldiers. The Roman Emperors in ancient times, wishing
to prevent the barbarians who dwelt beyond the Danube
from crossing it, occupied the whole shore of this river
with fortresses, which they built not only on the right
bank, but in some places also on the further bank of the
river. These fortresses were not constructed so as to be
inaccessible to assailants, but just sufficient not to leave
that bank of the river without defenders; for the barbarians
in that region did not understand siege operations.
Most of these strong places consisted only of one
tower, and were consequently called towers, and very few
men were stationed in them. This was at that time sufficient
to overawe the barbarian tribes, so that they made
no attacks upon the Romans; but in later times Attila
invaded the country with a great army, razed all these
fortresses to the ground without difficulty, and laid waste
the greater part of the Roman territory, without meeting
with any resistance. The Emperor Justinian rebuilt the
demolished forts, not in their original form, but in the
most powerful manner of fortification, and in addition to
them built many others. In this manner he entirely
restored the security of the Roman Empire, which had
been altogether lost. I shall now set forth the manner in
which all this was effected.</p>

<p>The river Danube, flowing from the mountains of the
Celts, who are now known as the Gauls, encloses a great
tract of country, for the most part entirely desert, but in
some places inhabited by barbarians, who dwell like
savages, without any intercourse with the rest of mankind.
On reaching Dacia, it first begins to divide the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"> 109</span>
barbarians who dwell on its left bank from the Roman
territory on the right bank. For this reason the Romans
call this part of Dacia ‘Ripensis’; for in the Latin language
a bank is called <i>ripa</i>. The first city which they
built on this bank was named Singedon, which in process
of time the barbarians captured, razed to the ground, and
rendered entirely desolate. Most of the other fortresses
were reduced to the same condition; but the Emperor
Justinian rebuilt it entirely, surrounded it with a strong
wall, and again made it a noble and admirable city. He
built a new fort of great strength, distant eight miles
from the city of Singedon,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which from that circumstance
is called Octavum. Beyond it there was an ancient city
named Viminacium, which the Emperor entirely rebuilt;
for it had long before been razed to the ground.</p>

<p>VI. Proceeding onward from the city of Viminacium,
three fortresses stand on the bank of the Danube, named
Picnus, Cupus, and Novæ, which formerly derived their
name from a single tower built in each place; now, however,
the Emperor Justinian added so many houses and
fortifications to each of these, that they came to be regarded
as considerable cities. On the further bank, opposite
Novæ, stood in ancient times a ruinous tower named
Litorata, which the ancients called Lederata. This place
was made by our Emperor into a large and very strong
fort. After Novæ are the forts of Cantabazates, Smornes,
Campses, Tanatas, Vernes, and Ducepratum, and many
more on the further bank, all of which he rebuilt from the
foundations. After this comes Caput-bovis, the work of
the Roman Emperor Trajan, and beyond it an ancient
fort named Zanes, all of which he enclosed with strong
fortifications, and rendered them impregnable bulwarks of
the empire. Not far from Zanes is a fort named Pontes,
where a stream leaves the river, encloses a small portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110"> 110</span>
of the bank, and then rejoining its true channel, unites
itself to the main river. It does this not by nature, but
compelled by human art. I will now describe why it
was that the place was named Pontes, and that the
Danube was forced to flow round this place.</p>

<p>The Roman Emperor Trajan, a spirited and energetic
man, appears to have been irritated at the thought that
the boundary of his empire was fixed by the river Danube.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
He was anxious, therefore, to throw a bridge across it, in
order that he might pass it without its offering any obstacle
when he marched against the barbarians beyond it. How
he built this bridge I shall take no pains to describe, but
shall let that be told by Apollodorus of Damascus, the
chief architect of the entire work. No advantage accrued
from it to the Romans, and the bridge subsequently was
destroyed by the stream of the Danube and by age.
Trajan built two forts on either bank of the river, and
called that on the further side Theodora and that on the
Dacian bank Pontem, from the name of the bridge; for
the Romans call a bridge <i>pons</i> in Latin. Since after
this the river became impassable for ships at this place,
owing to the ruins and foundations of the bridge, they
forced the river to adopt a new channel and perform a
circuit in order to afford them a passage beyond it. Both
these forts fell into ruins through age and the assaults of
the barbarians; but the Emperor Justinian rebuilt the
fort Pontem, on the right bank of the river, with new and
powerful fortifications, and thus secured Illyria. As for
that on the opposite bank, named Theodora, he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111"> 111</span>
it unnecessary to bestow any care upon it, since it was
exposed to the attacks of the barbarians in that region;
but he built all the new fortifications which stand on the
bank below Pontem at this day, which are named Mareburgus,
Susiana, Armata, Timena, Theodoropolis, Stiliburgus,
and Halicaniburgus. There is a small city near
this place, named Ad Aquas, some small part of whose
fortifications, which had become unsafe, were restored by
the Emperor. Beyond it he built Bergonovore, and
Laccobergus, and the fort named Dorticum, which he
made into the existing strong fortification. He altered
the solitary tower named Judæus into what may be called,
and really is, a most beautiful fort. He rebuilt Bergus
Altus, which formerly was deserted and altogether uninhabited,
and also enclosed with a wall another place
named Gombes. He rebuilt the fortifications of Crispas,
which had become ruinous from age, and built Longiniana
and Ponteserium in an admirable manner. At Bononia
and Novum he rebuilt the bastions which had become
ruinous. He rebuilt all the ruinous parts of the city of
Ratiaria; and in many other places he either enlarged
small fortifications or reduced over-large ones to a convenient
form, in order that neither their smallness nor
their excessive size might expose them to the attacks of
the enemy; as, for example, he turned Mocatiana from a
single tower into the more complete fort which it is at this
day, whilst at Almus he reduced the space enclosed by the
walls, which formerly was very great, thus enabling it to
defy the attacks of the enemy. In many places he altered
a solitary tower, an object of contempt to an invader, into
a strong fort, as at Tricesa and Putedis. He magnificently
restored the ruinous walls of Cebrus. He built a new fort
in Bigrane, and another one near to it, in a place where
formerly stood a single tower named Onos. Not far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112"> 112</span>
this there remained only the foundations of a city, which
in former times had been named Augusta, but which now,
possessing its ancient name, but having been altogether
rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian, is well peopled. He
rebuilt the ruined fortifications of Aëdabe, restored the
city of Variana, which had long been in ruins, and fortified
Valeriana, which before had possessed no defences.</p>

<p>Besides these, he paid attention to and enclosed with
strong fortifications other places not on the bank of the
river, but standing at a distance from it, named Castramartis,
Zetnocortum, and Iscum. He took great pains to
enclose with a wall and otherwise fortify an old fort on the
bank of the river, named the Fort of the Huns. Not far
from the Fort of the Huns is a place where a fort stands
on each bank of the Danube, the one in Illyria named
Palatiolum, while that on the opposite bank was named
Sicibida. These, which had become ruinous through age,
were restored by the Emperor Justinian, who thereby
checked the inroads of the barbarians in that quarter,
and beyond them rebuilt an ancient fort, now known as
Utos. On the extreme frontier of Illyria he built a
fort named Lapidaria, and altered a solitary tower, named
Lucernariaburgum, into a fort worthy of admiration.
The above were the works of the Emperor Justinian
in Illyria; he did not, however, merely strengthen this
country with fortifications, but placed in each of them
garrisons of regular soldiers, and thus checked the incursions
of the barbarians.</p>

<p>VII. Hitherto I have described the fortifications of
Illyria along the river Danube. We must now pass into
those which the Emperor Justinian built along its shores
in Thrace; for it appears convenient to me first to
describe the whole of this bank, and then to proceed to
the description of his works in the inland country. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113"> 113</span>
us then first proceed to the country of the Mysians,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
whom the poets speak of as fighting hand to hand; for
their country is conterminous with that of Illyria. After
Lucernariaburgum, the Emperor Justinian built the new
fort of Securisca, and beyond it restored the ruinous part
of Cyntodemus. Beyond this he built an entirely new
city, which, after the name of the Empress, he called
Theodoropolis. He renewed the ruinous part of the forts
which are named Iatron and Tigas, and added a tower to
that of Maxentius, of which he thought it stood in need.
He built the new fort of Cynton. Beyond this is the
fortification of Transmarisca, opposite to which, on the
further side of the river, the Roman Emperor Constantine
once built with great care a fort named Daphne, thinking
it advisable that at this place the river should be guarded
on both sides. This in process of time was entirely
destroyed by the barbarians, but was rebuilt from its
foundations by the Emperor Justinian. Beyond Transmarisca,
he took suitable pains to restore the fortresses of
Altinum and that called Candidiana, which long ago had
been destroyed by the same enemies. There are three
forts in succession along the bank of the Danube, named
Saltopyrgus, Dorostolus, and Sycidaba, in each of which
the Emperor repaired with great care such parts as had
become ruinous. He bestowed similar pains upon Quesoris,
which lies beyond the bank of the river, and enlarged
and greatly extended Palmatis, which stands in
a narrow pass, although it was not near the bank of the
river. Close to this he built a new fort, named Adina,
because the Sclavonian barbarians were wont to conceal
themselves there and lie in ambush, so as to render it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114"> 114</span>
impossible for travellers to proceed through that country.
He also built the fort of Tilicion and the outwork on the
left of it.</p>

<p>Thus was the bank of the Danube and its neighbourhood
fortified in Mysia.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> I shall now proceed to Scythia,
where the first fort is that named after St. Cyrillus, the
ruinous parts of which were most carefully rebuilt by the
Emperor Justinian. Beyond this was an ancient fortress
named Ulmiton, but as the Sclavonian barbarians had for
a long time infested that region, and made their habitation
there, it had become quite deserted, and nothing
remained of it except its name. He therefore rebuilt it
from its foundations, and rendered that part of the country
safe from the attacks of the Sclavonians. Next to this
is the city of Ibida, whose walls had become very ruinous,
but which he, without any delay, rebuilt and rendered
very strong. He built a new fort beyond it named
Ægistum, and restored another fort in the furthest part of
Scythia named Almyris, whose walls had for the greater
part fallen into decay, as he did to all the other fortifications
in this part of Europe.</p>

<p>VIII. I have described above the buildings constructed
by the Emperor Justinian among the Dardanians, Epirotes,
Macedonians, and the other tribes of the Illyrians, as well
as those in Greece and along the river Ister.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to Thrace, taking as the best foundation
for our narrative the neighbourhood of Byzantium,
since that city surpasses all others in Thrace, both in
strength and situation, for it overhangs Europe like a
citadel, and guards also the sea which divides it from Asia.
I have described above his works, both churches and
other buildings, within and without the walls of Constantinople;
I am now about to speak of what lies beyond them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115"> 115</span></p>

<p>There is a fort in the suburbs of the city, which from its
form is called the ‘round fort.’ The road which leads
from it to Rhegium passes for the most part over uneven
ground, and in rainy seasons used to become swampy and
difficult for travellers; now, however, our Emperor has
paved it with large stones, and made it easy to traverse.
In length this road reaches as far as Rhegium; its width is
such that two waggons going in opposite directions can
pass without difficulty. The stones of which it is formed
are very hard; one would imagine them to be millstones.
They are of enormous size, so that each of them covers
a large extent of ground, and stands up to a great height.
They form so smooth and level a surface that they do not
seem to be joined, or carefully let into one another, but to
have grown together. Such is this road. There is a lake
close to Rhegium, into which rivers flowing from the
higher ground discharge their waters. This lake reaches
as far as the sea, so that there is but one very narrow
bank between them, both washed on either side by their
several waters; when, however, they approach most
nearly to one another, they restrain their currents and
turn them back, as though they had there placed boundaries
for themselves. At one point they join one another,
leaving a channel between them, of which it is hard to
say to which water it belongs, for the water of the sea
does not always flow into the lake, nor does the lake always
discharge its waters into the sea; but after much rain, and
with a southerly wind, the water of the channel appears
to flow out of the lake; though if the wind blows from the
north, the sea appears to wash into the lake. In this
place the sea forms an immense extent of shoal-water,
with only one narrow channel leading through them into
deep water. This channel is so narrow that it is called
the ‘Ant.’ The channel which, as I have said before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116"> 116</span>
joins the lake to the sea, used in former times to be crossed
by a wooden bridge, though with great danger to the
passengers, who often fell into the water together with the
beams of the bridge; now, however, the Emperor Justinian
has raised the bridge upon high arches of stone, and
rendered the passage safe.</p>

<p>Beyond Rhegium there is a city named Athyra, whose
inhabitants he relieved from the distress from which he
found them suffering from want of water, by building a
reservoir there, in which the excess of their water might
be stored up, and supplied to them in time of need; he
also restored the ruinous part of their wall.</p>

<p>Beyond Athyra there is a place which the natives call
Episcopia. The Emperor Justinian perceiving that this
place lay exposed to the attacks of the enemy, more
especially as there was no strong place, but the country
was entirely unguarded, built a fort there, the towers of
which he constructed, not in the usual manner, but as
follows. From the ‘curtain’ wall projects a building,
narrow at first, but very wide at the outer end, upon which
each of the towers is built. It is not possible for an
enemy to approach near to this wall, since they come between
these towers, and are overwhelmed by the cross-fire
which the garrison easily pour upon their heads. He
placed the gates, not in the usual manner, between two
towers, but obliquely in a small projection of the wall, so
that they are not seen by the enemy, but are hidden behind
the wall. This work was performed for the Emperor
by Theodorus Silentiarius, a very clever man. Thus was
this fort constructed. We must now proceed to make
some mention of the ‘long walls.’</p>

<p>IX. The sea which proceeds from the ocean and Spain,
with Europe on its left hand, flows in the same easterly
direction as far as Thrace, but there divides into two por<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117"> 117</span>tions,
one of which proceeds towards the east, while
another makes a short bend and terminates in the Euxine
Sea. When it reaches Byzantium, it winds round the
city on its eastern side, as though round a goal, and continues
its course in a much more oblique direction, proceeding
by a strait which turns the upper and lower parts
of Thrace into an isthmus; not that the sea there is divided
into two parts, as is the case in other isthmuses, but it
circles round in a singular manner and embraces Thrace
on both sides, and more especially the whole suburbs of
Byzantium. These suburbs the inhabitants have built
over and adorned, not merely for their use, but with an
arrogant and boundless luxury, and with all the license
which is produced by wealth. Here they have stored
much furniture, and preserved many works of art. Whenever,
therefore, the barbarians suddenly invade the Roman
Empire, these places suffer far more damage than the rest,
and are in fact utterly ruined. The Emperor Anastasius,
wishing to prevent this, built long walls<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> at a place no less
than forty miles from Byzantium, joining the two seas
where they were distant two days’ journey from one
another. Having constructed these works, he supposed
that all within them had been made secure; they were,
however, the cause of still greater disasters, for it was not
possible either to build so enormous a work firmly, or to
guard it with proper care; while when the enemy made
themselves masters of one part of the long wall, they
conquered the remainder of the garrison without difficulty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118"> 118</span>
assailed the rest of the people unexpectedly, and did more
mischief than can easily be described.</p>

<p>Our Emperor, however, having rebuilt the ruinous part
of these walls, and strengthened their weak points so as
to assist their defenders, devised the following plan also.
He stopped up all the passages leading from one tower to
another, and arranged one single means of ascent from
the ground, within the walls of each, so that the garrison
could, if necessary, block up this passage and defy an
enemy, even though he had made his way within the wall,
since each tower is sufficient within itself for the defence
of its garrison. Within these walls he made the most
complete provision for safety, both by the buildings which
I have mentioned above, and by restoring the most ruinous
part of the wall of the city of Selybria.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> These were
the works of the Emperor Justinian at the ‘long walls.’</p>

<p>The well-known city of Heraclea,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> our neighbour on the
sea-coast, which formerly, under the name of Perinthus,
was the first city in Europe, and now is second to Constantinople
alone, not long ago was reduced to great straits
by want of water; not that the country near it was waterless,
or that those who built the city in ancient times had
neglected to supply it with water—for Europe abounds
with fountains, and the ancients took care to make aqueducts—but
time, as usual, destroyed the fabric of the
aqueduct either through contempt for the age of the
building, or encouraged to ruin it by the carelessness of
the citizens of Heraclea. This led to Heraclea being left
almost without inhabitants; while time produced the same
effect upon the palace there, which was a very magnificent
building. However, the Emperor Justinian did not neglect
this city, but in a truly royal manner furnished it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119"> 119</span>
sweet and transparent waters, and did not allow the palace
to lose its ancient reputation, for he restored the whole
of it.</p>

<p>A day’s journey from Heraclea is a place by the seaside
named Rhædestus, conveniently situated for the navigation
of the Hellespont, with a good harbour where merchant-ships
can moor and discharge their cargoes in quiet water,
and when reloaded can again put to sea without difficulty.
It is, however, exposed to attacks of barbarians if they
should make a sudden incursion into that country, being
neither fortified nor placed on difficult ground; for this
reason it was neglected by merchants, who disregarded it
through fear of this danger. Now, however, the Emperor
Justinian has not only rendered the place itself secure, but
has also provided for the safety of all those who dwell in
the neighbourhood by building a city at Rhædestus, with
a strong wall and of very remarkable size, in which, on an
invasion of the barbarians, all the people of the neighbourhood
can take refuge and save their lives and property.</p>

<p>X. Thus did the Emperor Justinian at Rhædestus;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> I
now proceed to his works in the Chersonesus. The Chersonesus
projects beyond that part of Thrace, for it runs
out into the sea and appears as though it proceeded as far
as Asia, and was joined on to it. Its shore forms a promontory
near the city of Elæus,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> thus dividing the sea
into two parts, while it itself is separated from the rest of
the mainland by the water which runs into a recess forming
what is called the Black Gulf; the rest of it almost
forms an island, from which shape it derives its name, for
it is called Chersonesus because it is only prevented by a
narrow isthmus from being altogether an island. Across
this isthmus the ancients carelessly built a wall which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120"> 120</span>
could be scaled with ladders, making it as low and narrow
as though they thought they were building a dry stone
wall round an out-of-the-way garden. In addition to this
they built low and mean works, of the kind called moles,
projecting into the sea on either side of the isthmus, and
thus fortified the space between the wall and the sea, but
in such a manner as not to repel invaders but to invite
them to make an attack, so contemptible and easily captured
was their fortification. Imagining, however, that
they had erected an impassable barrier against the enemy,
they did not think it necessary to build any strong place
within this wall, for there was no fort or any other place of
strength in the Chersonesus, though it extends for a distance
of nearly three days’ journey. Quite lately the
enemy invaded Thrace, made an attempt upon the passage
by the seashore, frightened away its guards, forced their
way in as if in sport, and gained the other side of the wall
without any difficulty.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justinian therefore, in his great care for
the safety of his subjects, did as follows: First, he utterly
destroyed the ancient wall so that no vestige of it was
left. He then built a second wall upon the same site, of
considerable width and height; above the battlements of
this he built a vaulted roof like a portico to shelter the
defenders, while a second range of battlements resting
upon these vaults doubled the defensive power of this work
against an enemy. After this, at each end of the wall, on
the very beach of the sea, he built two of the projecting
works named moles, reaching a long way into the water,
connected with the wall, and equalling it in height. He
also cleaned out the ditch outside the wall and excavated
it to a great width and depth; moreover, he placed a
garrison of soldiers within these long walls sufficient to
hold them against all the barbarians who might attack
the Chersonesus. After having made this part so strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121"> 121</span>
and secure, he nevertheless built additional fortifications
in the interior, so that if, which God forbid, any disaster
should befall the ‘long wall,’ the people of Chersonesus
would nevertheless be safe; for he enclosed the city of
Aphrodisias, which before had been for the greater part
defenceless, with a very strong wall, and supplied with
walls and inhabitants the city of Ciberis, building there
baths, hospices, numerous houses, and all that is necessary
for a magnificent city. He likewise most securely fortified
Callipolis,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> which had been left without walls by the
ancients, through their trust in the ‘long wall.’ Here he
built storehouses for corn and wine sufficient to supply all
the wants of the garrison of the Chersonesus.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Opposite Abydos is an ancient city named Sestos, which
also in former times was uncared-for and possessed no
defences. It was overhung by a very steep hill, upon
which he built a fort which is quite inaccessible, and impossible
to be taken by an enemy. Not far from Sestos
is Elæus, where a precipitous rock rises from the sea,
raising its summit high in the air and forming a natural
fortification. Upon this also the Emperor built a fort,
which is difficult to pass by and altogether impregnable;
moreover, he built a fort at Thescus, on the other side of
the ‘long wall,’ fortifying it with an exceedingly strong
wall. Thus did he provide in all quarters for the safety
of the inhabitants of the Chersonesus.</p>

<p>XI. Beyond Chersonesus is the city of Ænus,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122"> 122</span>
takes its name from that of its founder; for Æneas was,
according to tradition, the son of Anchises. The wall of
this place was easy of capture from its lowness, since it
did not reach to the necessary height, while it lay completely
exposed in the neighbourhood of the sea, where it
was washed by the waves. However, the Emperor Justinian
raised its walls to such a height that not only they
could not be taken, but could not even be assaulted; and,
by bringing them down to the seashore and strengthening
them in every quarter, rendered Ænus altogether impregnable.
Thus he provided for the safety of the city; but
the country remained exposed to the incursions of the
barbarians, because the (mountains of) Rhodope had been
from ancient times deficient in fortifications. In the interior
was a village named Bellurus, in wealth and population
equal to a city, but always exposed to the plundering
attacks of barbarians, on account of its being defenceless,
as was also a large extent of country round about it: this
place our Emperor made into a city, fortified, and rendered
worthy of himself; moreover he also restored with great
care all the fortifications which were wanting or had become
ruinous in the other cities in the Rhodope Mountains.
Among these were Trajanopolis and Maximianopolis,
whose walls he rebuilt where they were defective. These
were his works in this quarter.</p>

<p>In this country Anastasiopolis was already furnished with
walls, but, though lying near the sea, had an undefended
sea-beach, so that it often happened that the barbarian
Huns seized the vessels which lay there helpless, and
extended their ravages to the neighbouring islands. The
Emperor Justinian enclosed the whole sea-beach with a
fortification, and thus provided for the safety both of the
ships and of the islanders. He also constructed a very
lofty aqueduct leading to the city from the mountains in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123"> 123</span>
the neighbourhood. There is in Rhodope an ancient city
named Toperus, which is almost surrounded by a river,
and lies at the foot of a lofty hill, from which it had not
long before been captured by the barbarian Sclavonians;
but Justinian raised its wall to so great a height that it
rises above this hill as much as it formerly fell short of it.
He built a vaulted portico along the wall, so that the
garrison could defend the city in safety against besiegers,
and formed each of its towers into a strong castle. He
also strengthened it by enclosing the part between the
river and the city-wall by a cross-wall. These were the
works of the Emperor Justinian in this quarter.</p>

<p>I will now describe the other fortifications which he
built in the rest of Thrace, and in what is now called
Mount Hæmus. First, he carefully built up what was
wanting or ruinous at Philippopolis and Plotinopolis,
which were very weakly fortified, although they stood in
the neighbourhood of many tribes of barbarians. He also
established numberless forts throughout the whole of
Thrace, by means of which the country, which had formerly
been exposed to the inroads of the enemy, was
entirely preserved from their ravages; the names of these
forts, as far as my memory goes, are as follows.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_V">BOOK V.</h3>
</div>


<p>I. The works of Justinian in the whole of Europe have
been as far as possible described by me in the former portion
of this book; we must now proceed to the description
of the remainder of his works in Asia. I think that I have
described above the fortifications of cities and forts, and
the other buildings erected by him in the East, from the
Median frontier as far as the city of Palmyra in Phœnicia,
on the borders of Lebanon. I shall now speak of his
works in the remainder of Asia and Libya, describing both
the manner in which he repaired the roads, which were
difficult and dangerous, in some places steep and overhung
by rocky mountains, in others bordering upon rivers
which drowned travellers, and also how he repaired all
that was defective in the cities, beginning at the following
point.</p>

<p>Before the city of Ephesus<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> there is some high ground,
not formed of earth or capable of producing fruit, but
altogether hard and rocky. Here the inhabitants at
former times had built a church, dedicated to St. John the
Apostle, surnamed the Divine. This Apostle was named
the Divine because he has written about God in a manner
surpassing the nature of man. This church, which was
small and ruinous through age, the Emperor Justinian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"> 128</span>
razed to the ground, and rebuilt of such size and beauty,
that, in short, it resembles and in all respects vies with the
church dedicated by him to the Apostles in the imperial
city, which I have described above.</p>

<p>This was the work of our Emperor in Ephesus. In the
island of Tenedos I will presently describe the work which
he constructed for the advantage of the imperial city and
all seafarers, after making the following prefatory remarks.
The sea as far as the Hellespont is contained in
a narrow strait; for the two continents there approach
nearest to one another, forming the beginning of the
strait near Sestos and Abydos. Ships bound for Constantinople
consequently anchor when they reach this
place, because they are unable to proceed any further
unless the wind blows from the south. When, therefore,
the fleet of corn-ships sail thither from Alexandria, if it
meets with a favourable wind, the merchants in a very
short time moor their ships in the harbours of Byzantium,
and as soon as they have unloaded them, depart at once,
in order that they may all make this voyage for a second
or even a third time before the winter, while those of them
who choose take in some other merchandise for the return
voyage. If, however, the wind blows against them at the
Hellespont, both the corn and the ships become injured
by delay. Reflecting upon these things, the Emperor
Justinian has clearly proved that nothing is impossible for
man, even when he has to contend with the greatest difficulties;
for he built granaries on the island of Tenedos,
which is close to the strait, of a sufficient size to contain
the freight of the whole fleet, being in width no less than
ninety feet, in length two hundred and eighty, and of
great height. After the Emperor had constructed these,
when those who were conveying the public supply of corn
were detained by contrary winds at this point, they used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129"> 129</span>
to unload their cargo into the granary, and, disregarding
the northerly and westerly winds and all the other winds
which were unfavourable for them, would prepare for
another voyage. They therefore at once sailed home,
while afterwards, whenever it became convenient to sail
from Tenedos to Byzantium, the corn was conveyed from
Tenedos thither in other ships by persons appointed to
perform this duty.</p>

<p>II. In Bithynia there is a city<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> named after Helena, the
mother of the Emperor Constantine, in which they say
that Helena was born, and which in former times was an
inconsiderable village. The Emperor Constantine, out of
filial duty, gave this place its name and the dignity of a
city, but built nothing there on an imperial or magnificent
scale; for the place remained in its former condition in
respect of its buildings, but merely had the glory of being
called a city, and prided itself on being named after
Helena, to whom it had given birth. However, the
Emperor of our own age, as though wishing to put away
the reproach of the founder of the empire, first supplied
this city, which he found suffering from want of water,
with a magnificent aqueduct, and furnished the inhabitants
beyond their expectation with enough water not
only to drink, but also to wash in, and to use for all the
other luxuries of life, as they were now supplied with
water in abundance; in addition to this he built for them
a new public bath, and restored another which had fallen
into ruins and been neglected through the want of water
which I have mentioned, so that it had all fallen to the
ground. He also built churches, palaces, porticos, and
dwellings for the magistrates, and supplied all the other
needs of a flourishing city.</p>

<p>Close by this city flows a river, which the natives from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130"> 130</span>
its form call Draco (the snake); for it winds in curves on
either hand, often proceeding in opposite directions, bending
its waters round in a crooked course, and flowing now
to the right hand and now to the left; so that travellers
coming to the city were obliged to cross it more than
twenty times.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Many of them thus perished through the
river suddenly rising in flood; besides which, a thick wood
and masses of reeds, which encumbered its outfall into
the sea, made it a source of trouble to the country; indeed,
not very long ago, after much rain, it overflowed its
banks and inundated a great part of the country, doing
irreparable damage; for it swept away many fields,
uprooted vines, olives, and numberless fruit-trees of all
kinds, and also the houses which stood outside the walls of
the city, besides doing other important damage to the
inhabitants. The Emperor Justinian, out of pity for
them, devised the following plan: he cleared away the
woods, and cut down all the reeds, so as to enable the
river to discharge itself freely into the sea, so that it would
no longer be forced to overflow its banks. He also cut
through the mountains which stand in that country, and
made a carriage-road through places which formerly had
been rough and precipitous. By this means he rendered
it unnecessary for the greater part of the inhabitants to
cross the river at all, whilst he threw two bridges of great
width across it, so that henceforth they could pass over it
without danger.</p>

<p>III. The excellent works which he constructed at
Nicæa,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> in Bithynia, are worthy of mention. In the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131"> 131</span>
place, he restored the whole of the aqueduct, which had
entirely fallen into ruin and become useless, and thus
furnished the city with an abundant supply of water.
Next he built churches and convents both for women and
men. He carefully restored the whole of the palace there,
some part of which was in ruins, and likewise a bath in
the place which is called the ‘Couriers’ Lodgings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132"> 132</span>,‘ and
which had long been ruinous. Close to this city, on the
west side, a torrent is wont to rush down, making the
road in that direction entirely impassable. The ancients
had constructed a bridge here, which in the course of
time became unable to withstand the rush of the torrent,
as it was not kept in proper repair, so that it yielded to
the force of the stream, and was swept away, leaving no
trace on the spot where it formerly stood. The Emperor
Justinian built another bridge here, of such height and
width that the former one seemed to bear no proportion
to it whatever, which rises high above the torrent when
at its fullest, and affords a safe passage to travellers.</p>

<small><i>Reduced from Texier’s Asia Minor. G.A.</i></small></div>
</div>

<p>At Nicomedia<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> he rebuilt the Baths of Antoninus,
the most important part of which had fallen down, and
from the vastness of its size seemed unlikely ever to
be rebuilt. The great river which is now called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133"> 133</span>
Sangaris,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which runs with an exceedingly
swift current, is of great depth in the middle,
and of width like a sea, and had never been
spanned by a bridge since the creation;
however, by lashing a number of boats
together, and connecting them with each
other like mat-work, foot-passengers ventured
to cross it, as once the army of Medes
crossed the Hellespont, fearing the wrath of
Xerxes. This, however, they did not accomplish
without danger, for the river often
swept away all the boats, together with their
fastenings, and made it impossible for travellers
to cross it. Now, however, the Emperor
Justinian has attempted to build a bridge
over it. The work is begun, and he has
already expended much labour upon it; so
that I am sure that before long he will accomplish
it, for I know that Heaven assists him
in all his works, so that up to this time none
of his projects have remained unaccomplished,
although in many cases he at first
seemed to be undertaking impossibilities.</p>


<div class="figleft illowp12" id="i_p133" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
<a id="fig_10"></a>
  <img src="images/i_p133.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"> BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER SANGARIS.<br />
<small><i>Reduced from Texier’s Asia Minor</i></small></div>
</div>

<p>There is a road in Bithynia leading thence
into Phrygia, upon which in the winter
season innumerable men and animals used
to perish; for the ground, being soft, not
only after great rains, or the melting of great
quantities of snow, but even after slight
showers, became deep, impassable mud, and
turned the road into a swamp, in which
travellers were frequently swallowed up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134"> 134</span>
He, however, together with the Empress Theodora, with
magnificent generosity, removed this source of danger
to travellers; for they raised the thoroughfare safely
upon enormous stones for a distance of half a day’s
journey for a lightly-equipped traveller, and enabled
passengers to proceed along a firm road. These were
the works of the Emperor Justinian in this quarter.</p>

<p>In Bithynia there are springs of warm water in the
place called Pythia. These springs are made use of by
many persons, especially the inhabitants of Byzantium,
for pleasure, and above all for the healing of those suffering
from disease. Here he displayed a truly imperial
magnificence; for he built a palace, which had not existed
before, and public baths supplied with the warm water.
He also brought hither drinking water by an aqueduct
from distant fountains, and relieved the place from the
drought from which it had formerly suffered. Besides this,
he rebuilt on a larger and much more magnificent scale
the Church of the Archangel and the infirmary for the sick.</p>

<p>IV. There is a river in Galatia which the inhabitants
call the Siberis,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> near the place called Sycæ, and about ten
miles from the city of Juliopolis, on the eastern side.
This river often rose suddenly to a great height and swept
away many of the travellers along that road. The Emperor
Justinian, grieved at hearing this, put a stop to these
disasters for the future by spanning the river with a
powerful bridge, capable of withstanding the force of a
flooded river. He also formed the eastern abutment of
the bridge into a projecting wall, of the form technically
known as a bulwark. He also built a church for travellers
on the western side of it, which might serve as a
refuge for them in times of storm. The river, which flows
past the western side of this city of Juliopolis, used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135"> 135</span>
shake and injure its walls; however, our Emperor
restrained it by building an embankment parallel to the
city wall for a distance of not less than five hundred feet.
By this means he preserved the fortifications of the city
from being washed away.</p>

<p>The following were his works in Cappadocia. There
has been there since ancient times a very large and populous
city named Cæsarea, which was surrounded by a
wall of such excessive extent as to render it weak and
altogether indefensible, because it enclosed a large space
which was not necessary for the city, and was exposed to
attack by its useless length; for there are lofty hills, not
near to one another, but at a considerable distance, which
the founder of the city was anxious to enclose within its
walls, lest they should be used to attack it from, so that
thus, under the pretext of safety, he really exposed it to
great danger, by enclosing many fields and gardens,
besides crags and high pasture-land, on which the inhabitants
did not subsequently build any houses, but left it in
its former condition, the few houses upon it remaining
solitary and isolated to the present day. The garrison
was not sufficient to guard such a great extent of wall, nor
were the inhabitants able to keep it in repair, so that they
lived in terror of attack, just as though they had no walls
at all. However, the Emperor Justinian pulled down the
unnecessary part of the wall, concentrated the city within
a really efficient rampart, and made the place impregnable
to all assailants, strengthening it with a sufficient garrison.
Thus did he provide for the safety of the people of Cæsarea
in Cappadocia.</p>

<p>There was in Cappadocia a fortress named Mocesus,
standing on level ground, whose wall was so decayed that
some part of it had already fallen, and the rest was like
to fall. The Emperor Justinian demolished this fort, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136"> 136</span>
built a new and very great wall to the westward of the old
fort, on a lofty spot inaccessible to any assailants. Here
he built many churches, hospices, public baths, and everything
else which belongs to a flourishing city; so that this
place came to be regarded as the metropolis, which is the
name given by the Romans to the first city of a nation.
These were his works in Cappadocia.</p>

<p>V. Along the road leading from the city of Antiochia,
now called Theopolis, towards Cilicia, is a suburb named
Platanon. Not far from this city was an ancient path,
confined in a narrow glen between two mountains, which
had been for the greater part washed away by the rains,
so as to render it dangerous to travellers proceeding along
it. When the Emperor Justinian heard of this, he spent
much pains and thought upon it, and at once discovered
a remedy for this evil; for at a vast expense he cut down
and overcame the difficulties of the mountains in that
region for a great distance, so that, beyond everyone’s
hope and expectation, he made a level and wide carriage-road
over what had formerly been precipice, clearly
proving that by wise plans and lavish expenditure men
can overcome all obstacles. These were his works in that
quarter.</p>

<p>There is in Cilicia a city named Mopsuestia,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> the work,
it is said, of the celebrated ancient prophet (Mopsus).
Beside this runs the river Pyramus, which is an ornament
to the city, but is only traversed by one bridge. In the
course of ages the greater part of this bridge became
ruinous, so that it continually threatened to fall, and all
who crossed it did so with the fear of death before their
eyes. Thus, a work devised by the ancients for men’s
safety had, through the negligence of those in charge of
it, become a source of danger and terror; however, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137"> 137</span>
Emperor carefully restored all the ruinous parts of the
bridge, so as to afford security to those who crossed it,
and enabled the city again to take a pride in the river unalloyed
with fear.</p>

<p>Beyond this is the city of Adana, round the eastern side
of which runs a river named Sarus,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which rises in the
mountains of Armenia. The Sarus is a navigable river,
and is nowhere fordable on foot. Here in ancient times
there had been constructed a large and admirable bridge,
in the following manner. In the river were built many
piers, formed of large stones of great thickness, extending
across the whole width of the river, and rising high above
its surface. Above the two central ones rise two lofty
arches. These piers, standing in the water, and having
to withstand the force of a strong current, had in the
course of ages become for the most part ruinous, so that
at no distant time it appeared probable that the whole
bridge would fall into the river, and every man who
crossed it prayed that it might only just hold together
until he had done so. However, the Emperor Justinian
dug a new channel for the river, into which he diverted
its stream for a time, removed the water from the above-mentioned
piers, promptly removed the ruinous portions
of them, and rebuilt them, after which he turned the river
back again into the channel which is called its bed. These
were his proceedings here.</p>

<p>The river Cydnus<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> runs through the midst of the city of
Tarsus, and appears to have done no injury to it at any
time except once, when it caused great destruction in the
following manner: the season was spring-time, and a
south wind, which suddenly began to blow with great
strength, melted all the snow with which in winter-time
the Tarsus Mountains are almost entirely covered. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138"> 138</span>
consequence of this streams of water ran down from every
part of those mountains, all the ravines poured down
torrents, and numerous springs inundated all the skirts
of the Tarsus range. The river Cydnus, swollen high by
these waters which were poured into it by its tributaries,
and by heavy rains which afterwards fell, overflowed and
entirely washed away all the suburbs of Tarsus on the
southern side, poured furiously into the city, sweeping
away the bridges, which were of slight construction, inundated
all the streets and market-places, and even rose
as high as the upper stories of the houses. For a night
and a day the city remained in this danger and distress,
after which the river gradually retired and returned to its
usual bed. When the Emperor Justinian heard of this,
he devised the following plan. In the first place, he prepared
a second channel for the river outside the city, in
order that it might there divide its stream, and might only
pour half its waters upon the city of Tarsus: next, he
built the bridges very much wider, and rendered them too
strong to be swept away by the flooded Cydnus. Thus he
enabled the inhabitants of the city to dwell in it without
alarms or dangers for the future.</p>

<p>VI. These were the works of the Emperor Justinian in
Cilicia. At Jerusalem he built a church in honour of the
Virgin,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> to which no other can be compared. The inhabitants
call it the ‘new church.’ I shall describe what it is
like, prefacing my account by the remark that this city
stands for the most part upon hilly ground, which hills are
not formed of earth, but are rough and precipitous, so as
to make the paths up and down them as steep as ladders.
All the rest of the buildings in the city stand in one place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139"> 139</span>
being either built upon the hills, or upon flat and open
ground; but this church alone stands in a different position;
for the Emperor Justinian ordered it to be built
upon the highest of the hills, explaining of what size he
wished it to be, both in width and in length. The hill
was not of sufficient size to enable the work to be carried
out according to the Emperor’s orders, but a fourth part
of the church, that towards the south wind and the rising
sun, in which the priests perform the sacred mysteries,
was left with no ground upon which to rest. Accordingly
those in charge of this work devised the following expedient:
they laid foundations at the extremity of the flat
ground, and constructed a building rising to the same
height as the hill. When it reached the summit, they
placed vaults upon the walls and joined this building to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141"> 141</span>
the other foundations of the church; so that this church
in one place is built upon a firm rock, and in another
place is suspended in the air—for the power of the
Emperor has added another portion to the (original) hill.
The stones of this substruction are not of the size of those
which we are accustomed to see: for the builders of this
work, having to contend with the nature of the ground,
and being forced to raise a building equal in size to a
mountain, scorned the ordinary practices of building, and
betook themselves to strange and altogether unknown
methods. They cut blocks of stone of enormous size out
of the mountains which rise to vast heights in the neighbourhood
of the city, cunningly squared them, and brought
them thither in the following manner: they built waggons
of the same size as these stones, and placed one stone
upon each waggon. These waggons were dragged by
picked oxen, chosen by the Emperor, forty of them dragging
each waggon with its stone. Since it was impossible
for the roads leading into the city to take these waggons
upon them, they made a passage for them by cutting
deeply into the mountains, and thus formed the church of
the great length which it was the Emperor’s pleasure that
it should have. After they had built it of a proportional
width they were not able to put a roof upon it. While
they were inspecting every grove and place which they
heard was planted with tall trees, they discovered a thick
wood, producing cedars of enormous height, with which
they made the roof of the church, of a height proportional
to its length and width. These were the works<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which the
Emperor Justinian constructed by human power and art,
though assisted by his pious confidence, which in its turn
reflected honour upon himself, and helped him to carry
out his design. This church required to be surrounded
on every side with columns, such as in beauty would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142"> 142</span>
worthy of the main building, and of a size capable of supporting
the weight which would be laid upon them.
However, the place, from its inland situation at a distance
from the sea, and its being entirely surrounded by the precipitous
mountains which I have mentioned, rendered it
impossible for the builders of the foundation to bring
columns thither from elsewhere. While, however, the
Emperor was grieving at this difficulty, God pointed out
in the nearest mountains a bed of stone of a kind suitable
for this purpose, which either had existed there in former
times and been concealed, or was then created. Either
story is credible to those who regard God as the cause of
it: for we, measuring everything by our human strength,
think that many things belong to the region of the impossible,
while for God nothing whatever is difficult or
impossible. The church, then, is supported by a great
number of columns brought from this place, of very great
size, and of a colour which resembles flame, which stand,
some above, some below, and some round the porticos
which encircle the entire church, except on the side turned
towards the east. Of these columns, the two which stand
before the door of the church are of very unusual size, and
probably second to no columns in the whole world. Beyond
them is another portico, named the Narthex (reed),
I suppose because it is narrow; after this is a court of
square shape supported by columns of equal size; from
this lead interior doors of such grandeur as to show those
passing them what a spectacle they are about to meet
with. Beyond this is a wonderful porch, and an arch
supported on two columns at a great height. Proceeding
further, there stand two semicircles, opposite to one another,
on each side of the way to the church; while on
either side of the other road are two hospices—the work
of the Emperor Justinian—one of which is destined for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143"> 143</span>
the reception of strangers, while the other is an infirmary
for the sick poor. The Emperor Justinian also endowed
this Church of the Virgin with large revenues. Such were
the works of the Emperor Justinian in Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144"> 144</span></p>

</div>

<p>VII. There is a city in Palestine named Neapolis, which
is overhung by a lofty mountain named Gerizim.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> This
mountain was originally held by the Samaritans, who
ascended it at all seasons in order to pray, not that they
had ever built a church there, but worshipped and
reverenced the summit of the mountain above everything
else. Jesus, the Son of God, when in the flesh, went
amongst these people, and held a conversation with one
of the women of the country. When she inquired of Him
about the mountain, He told her that in future times the
Samaritans should not worship in this mountain, but that
the true worshippers should worship Himself there,
alluding to the Christians. In process of time this prophecy
came to pass, for it was not possible that the true
God should lie. It came to pass in the following manner.
In the reign of the Emperor Zeno, the Samaritans
suddenly collected together, and fell upon the Christians in
Neapolis, who were keeping the feast called Pentecost in
their church, and killed many of them, while they struck
with their swords the Bishop, by name Terebinthius—whom
they found standing before the holy table, engaged in
celebrating the sacrament—so as, amongst other wounds,
to cut off the fingers from his hands, while they insulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145"> 145</span>
the holy mysteries in a manner fit indeed for Samaritans
to do, but not fit for us to speak of. This priest shortly
afterwards came to Byzantium, into the presence of the
then Emperor, to whom he showed what he himself had
suffered, described what had taken place, and begged the
Emperor to avenge what had been done, reminding him
of the prophecy of Christ. The Emperor Zeno, much
moved at what had taken place, without delay inflicted a
full measure of punishment upon those who had been
guilty of this outrage. He drove the Samaritans out of
Mount Gerizim, handed it over to the Christians, and
built upon the summit a church which he dedicated to
the Virgin, which he enclosed with what was indeed
called a wall, but which in truth was a dry stone fence.
He placed a sufficient number of soldiers as a garrison in
the city below, but in the church and its fortification not
more than ten. The Samaritans, enraged at these proceedings,
were filled with anger, and remained sulky and
dissatisfied, though, through fear of the Emperor, they
kept silence. In process of time, however, in the reign of
Anastasius, the following event took place. Some of the
Samaritans, at the instigation of a woman, climbed unexpectedly
up the steep face of the mountain, for the road
which leads up it from the city was strictly guarded, so
that it was impossible for them to ascend by it. Falling
suddenly upon the church, they killed the guards who
were posted there, and called with a loud voice upon the
Samaritans in the city to join them. They, however,
fearing the soldiers, were not at all willing to join the
conspirators; and not long afterwards the governor of the
province (he was named Procopius, of the city of Edessa,
an eloquent man) captured those who had been guilty of
this outrage, and put them to death. Yet even then the
Emperor did not bestow any attention or care upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"> 146</span>
fortification; but in our own time the Emperor Justinian,
although he has for the most part converted the
Samaritans to a better religion, and rendered them
Christians, yet, leaving the old wall round the church upon
Gerizim in its former condition of loose stones, as I described
before, he enclosed it within a second wall, and
rendered it altogether impregnable. In this place he also
rebuilt five Christian churches which had been burned by
the Samaritans. These were his works in this country.</p>

<p>VIII. In the country which was formerly called Arabia,
but which now is known as the Third Province of Palestine,
a desert tract extends for a great distance, entirely
barren of fruits, of water, and of all good things. A precipitous
and savagely wild mountain, named Sina, stands close to the Red
Sea. It is not necessary at this point in
my narrative for me to give a description of these regions,
since in my ‘History of the Wars’ I have given an exact
account of the whole of the country near the Red Sea
and the so-called Arabian Gulf, and of the tribes of
the Auxomite Ethiopians, and the Homerite Saracens.
There also I have described how the Emperor Justinian
added the palm-grove<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to the Roman Empire. I therefore
omit to speak of this, that I may not incur the charge
of want of taste. In this Mount Sina<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> dwell monks, whose
life is but a careful study of death, and who therefore
enjoy without fear the solitude which is dear to them.
Since these monks have no desires, but are superior to all
human passions, and as they possess nothing and spend
no care upon their persons, nor seek for pleasure from
anything else whatever, the Emperor Justinian built a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147"> 147</span>
church for them, which he dedicated to the Virgin, that
they might therein spend their life in continual prayer and
service of God. He did not build this church on the
summit of the mountain, but a long way below it; for it is
not possible for a man to pass the night upon the peak,
because at night continuous thunderings and other yet more
terrible divine manifestations take place, which overpower
men’s strength and reason. Here it was that Moses is said
to have received the Law from God, and to have brought
it away. At the foot of the mountain our Emperor also
built a very strong fort, and placed in it a very considerable
garrison of soldiers, in order that the barbarian Saracens
might not from that point, the country being, as I have said,
a desert, secretly invade Palestine. This is what he did
here; but what he did in the monasteries, both here and
in the remainder of the East, I will now briefly enumerate.</p>

<p>IX, In Jerusalem he restored the following monasteries:
that of St. Thalelæus, St. Gregorius, and St. Panteleemon in
the desert of Jordan; the hospice at Jericho;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> the church
of the Virgin at Jericho; the church of the Iberians at
Jerusalem; the church of the Lazi in the desert of
Jerusalem; the church of St. Mary in the Mount of Olives;
the church of the well of St. Elisæus;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> the church of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148"> 148</span>
Siletheus; the church of the Abbot Romanus. He restored
the wall of Bethlehem, and the church of the Abbot
Joannes at Bethlehem.</p>

  <div class="caption">CHURCH AT BETHLEHEM.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></div>
</div>

<p>He built cisterns and reservoirs as follows: in the monastery
of St. Samuel, a wall and a cistern; in the monastery of
the Abbot Zacharia, a cistern; in the monastery of Susanna,
a cistern; in the monastery of Aphelius, a cistern; in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149"> 149</span>
monastery of St. John beside the Jordan, a cistern;<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in the
monastery of St. Sergius in the mountain named Cisseron,
a cistern; the wall of Tiberias;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the poor-house at Bostra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150"> 150</span>
in Phœnicia; the house of the Virgin at Porphyreon;<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the
monastery of St. Phoca in the mount; the house of
St. Sergius in Ptolemaïs;<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the house of St. Leontius at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151"> 151</span>
Damascus. In the suburbs of Apamea<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> he restored the
poor-house of St. Romanus; he built the wall of St. Marox;
he restored the church of Daphne<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> in the suburbs of
Theopolis; at Laodicea<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> he restored the church of St.
John; in Mesopotamia he restored the monastery of
St. John, and the monasteries of Thelphrache, Zebinus,
Theodotus, Joannes, Sarmathe, Cyrene, Begadacum, and
the monastery at Apadnæ, in Isauria.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> He rebuilt the bath
and poor-house of the city of Cyricum; the poor-house of
St. Conon, and the aqueduct of the same saint in Cyprus;
the house of SS. Cosmas and Damianus in Pamphylia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152"> 152</span>
and the poor-house of St. Michael in the seaport which
is called the naval arsenal of the city of Perga, in Pamphylia.</p>

</div>


<p>I. The above were the works of Justinian in those
regions. What he did at Alexandria was as follows. The
river Nile does not flow as far as Alexandria, but, after
reaching the city which is named Chæreum,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> proceeds to
the left, leaving the country about Alexandria. In consequence
this the ancients, in order that the city might
not be entirely cut off from the river, dug a deep channel
from Chæreum, and succeeded in making a small part of
the stream of the river Nile run through it, by which, as
by other channels, it discharges its waters into the lake
Maria. This channel was nowhere navigable for large
ships, but men at Chæreum transfer Egyptian corn from
them to boats named <i>diaremata</i>, and so bring it to the city,
which they can reach by the river which flows through
this channel. They store up the corn in the place which
the Alexandrians call Phiale. Since it often happened
that when the populace rose in revolt, the corn in this
place was destroyed, the Emperor Justinian enclosed it
with a wall, and prevented any attacks being made upon
the corn. These were the works of the Emperor Justinian
in this place. However, since the course of our
narrative has brought us into Egypt, a country which
borders upon Libya, let us describe his works in that
country also, since this Emperor found the whole of Libya
in the possession of barbarians, and annexed it to the
Roman Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153"> 153</span></p>

<p>The river Nile, which flows from the Indies into Egypt,
divides that land into two portions down to the sea. The
land, which is divided by the river, is divided also in name;
for the country on the right bank of the river is named
Asia, as far as the river Phasìs in Colchis, which divides
the land of Asia from that of Europe, or indeed to the
Cimmerian straits and the river Tanais; for geographers
are at issue upon this point, which I have mentioned in
the description of the Euxine Sea in my ‘History of the
Wars.’ The country on the left bank of the Nile is called
Libya as far as the main ocean, which divides the two
continents in the West by interposing an arm between
them, which forms our (Mediterranean) Sea. The whole
of Libya is divided into various provinces, called, probably,
after the name of their inhabitants; but the name
of Libya at the present day is applied only to the territory
of Pentapolis,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> which extends from the frontier at Alexandria
as far as the city of Cyrene. In it there is a city,
situated at a distance of two days’ journey from Alexandria,
named Taphosiris,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> in which it is said that the Egyptian
god Osiris is buried. In this city the Emperor Justinian
constructed magistrates’ houses, public baths, and other
buildings.</p>

<p>II. The greater part of this country of Libya is desert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154"> 154</span>
and was almost entirely neglected: yet our Emperor in
his watchful care took measures to prevent its incurring
any damage from invasion by the neighbouring Moors, for
he built two forts and established garrisons in them. One
of these forts is named Paratonium, and the other Antipyrgum,
which stands near Pentapolis. Pentapolis is distant
from Alexandria eight days’ journey for a lightly-equipped
traveller. In this country of Pentapolis the
Emperor Justinian likewise very strongly fortified the city
Teuchria,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and rebuilt from its foundations the wall<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of
Berenice,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> where he also built a public bath for the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155"> 155</span>
the citizens; moreover, on the southern frontier of Pentapolis
he fortified two monasteries, named Agriolodes and
Dinarthion, by which he restrained the barbarians in that
quarter from making sudden and unexpected inroads on
the Roman territory.</p>

<p>There is in this country a city, named Ptolemaïs,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> which
in former times was flourishing and populous, but in process
of time became almost deserted through want of
water; for the greater part of the inhabitants long ago
suffered from drought so much that they left it and dispersed
in various directions. Now, however, our Emperor
has rebuilt the aqueduct which supplied the city with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156"> 156</span>
water, and restored it to its former appearance of prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
The furthest city of Pentapolis upon the western
frontier is that of Borium,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> where mountains, standing
close together, seem to form a barrier which shuts out the
enemy from invading the country. The Emperor, finding
this city unwalled, enclosed it with a very strong rampart,
thus rendering it and the whole of the country round it
quite secure for the future.</p>

<p>There are two cities, both of which pass under the same
name, being both called Augila.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> They stand at a distance
of about four days’ journey from Borium for a lightly
equipped traveller, on the southern side of it. They are
old cities, and the habits of their citizens are old-fashioned:
for all of them, even in my own time, practised the rites
of polytheism. Here in ancient times were temples dedicated
to Ammon, and to Alexander of Macedon, to whom
the inhabitants used to offer sacrifice down to the reign of
Justinian, and there was in them a large number of persons
called Slaves of the Temple: now, however, our
Emperor, who not only provides for the security of the
bodies of his subjects, but is also careful to save their
souls, took all necessary measures for the benefit of those
who dwelt here, making liberal provisions for them in all
respects, and above all teaching them the true religion, so
that he made them all Christians in a body, and turned
them from their pagan ancestral customs. He also built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157"> 157</span>
for them a temple of the Virgin, to serve as a fortress for
the safety of the city and of the true religion. These were
his works in this quarter.</p>

<p>The city of Borium, lying near the Moorish barbarians,
has remained free from imposts down to this time, nor
have any gatherers of tribute or taxes visited it since the
creation. From ancient times Jews dwelt close to it, and
had an ancient temple which they greatly respected and
reverenced, as it had, according to tradition, been built
by Solomon the King of the Hebrew nation. However,
the Emperor Justinian compelled them all to desert
their ancestral religion and become Christians, while he
turned this temple into a church.</p>

<p>III. Beyond this lie what are called the Great Syrtes.
I will explain what their appearance is, and why they have
received this name. The shore in this quarter, divided by
the inroads of the sea, and washed away by the beating of
the waves, seems to retire and to withdraw itself inland,
so as to form an immense crescent-shaped gulf. The
distance across the mouth of this gulf is forty stadia,
while the perimeter of the crescent extends to a distance
of six days’ journey. The sea forms this gulf by pressing
against the mainland; and when a ship is once forced by
the wind or the waves within the horns of the crescent, it
is thenceforth impossible for it to retrace its course, but it
seems dragged along, and always forced further forward.
It was, I imagine, from this destruction of ships that the
ancients called the place Syrtes. Nor can ships float as
far as the shore, for the greater part of the gulf is full
of sunken rocks, which make it impossible for ships to
float there, so that they are wrecked in the shallows.
The crews of these ships can only escape, if they escape
at all, in small boats, and reach the land with very great
danger. Here is the frontier of the region named Tripolis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158"> 158</span>
In it dwell Moorish barbarians of Phœnician origin. Here
is also a city named Cidama, inhabited by Moors who
have long been on terms of friendship with the Romans,
and all of whom, by the persuasion of the Emperor Justinian,
voluntarily adopted the Christian faith. These
Moors are now called Pacati, because they always are at
peace with the Romans; for the Romans in the Latin
language call peace <i>pacem</i>. Tripolis is distant from Pentapolis
a journey of twenty days’ journey for a lightly
equipped traveller.</p>

<p>IV. Beyond this is the city of Leptis Magna,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> which in
ancient times was great and populous, but since has
become almost entirely deserted, having through neglect
been mostly buried with sand. Our Emperor rebuilt its
walls from the foundation, not, however, enclosing so
great an extent as formerly, but much less, in order that
the city might not again be exposed to danger, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159"> 159</span>
from human enemies or from the sand, by its great size.
He left the buried part of the city as it was, covered with
heaps of sand, and fortified the rest in the strongest
manner. Here he built an admirable church, dedicated
to the Virgin, besides four others. In addition to this, he
also rebuilt the ruinous palace which formerly existed
here, the work of the Emperor Severus the elder, who was
born in this place, and left this palace as a memorial of his
good fortune.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this part of my narrative, I cannot
pass over the great event which took place at Leptis
Magna in our time. When Justinian had already come
to the throne, and before he had begun the war against
the Vandals, the Moorish barbarians called Leucathæ
overpowered the Vandals, who were then masters of Libya,
and reduced Leptis Magna to an utter desert. Being
encamped with their generals upon some hilly ground not
far from Leptis Magna, they suddenly beheld a flame of
fire in the midst of the city. Supposing that the enemy
had entered it, they rushed hurriedly to attack them; but
finding no one there, they laid the matter before their
prophets, who, interpreting what had taken place, foretold
that at no distant time Leptis Magna would be inhabited.
Not long afterwards the army of the Emperor arrived,
conquered the Vandals and Moors in battle, and gained
possession of Tripolis and the rest of Libya. I now return
from this digression to my narrative.</p>

<p>In this city the Emperor Justinian built public baths,
rebuilt the walls from their foundations, and gave both
the baths and all other public buildings an appearance
worthy of a city. Moreover, he induced the neighbouring
barbarians, named Gadabitani, who up to this time were
entirely given up to the Greek form of paganism, to
become zealous Christians, as they are at this day. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160"> 160</span>
also fortified the city of Sabaratha, in which he built a
most notable church.</p>

<p>In the further part of this country there are two cities,
named Tacapa<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and Girgis, between which lies the lesser
Syrtis. Here every day a wonderful phenomenon takes
place. The sea, pent up in a narrow place, forms there a
crescent-shaped gulf, such as I described in the other
Syrtis. Here the sea flows into the mainland for a distance
of more than eight days’ journey for a lightly
equipped traveller, and towards evening retires again,
leaving the shore there dry, like any other sea-beach.
Sailors bound for this land, which at times becomes sea,
sail in the ordinary manner as far as they are able in the
day-time, but towards nightfall prepare to pass the night
on dry land. They carry long poles on purpose, and as
soon as they suspect that the waters are about to ebb,
they take these poles in their hands, and without any
hesitation leap out of the ship. At first they swim, but
afterwards, when the water does not reach above their
faces, they stand on their feet, and sticking the points of
their poles into the ground, which by this time is, or
shortly will be, dry, they fix them upright underneath their
ship, supporting it on either side, that it may not be
damaged by falling to one side or the other. Early on
the following morning the land is again covered by the
waves of the sea, which raises the ships and causes them
to float; then the sailors take up their poles and sail on
again. This proceeding never varies, but this interchange
of the elements takes place every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161"> 161</span></p>

<p>V. After Tripolis and the Syrtis, let us proceed to the
rest of Libya. We must begin with Carthage, which is
the largest and most important of the cities in this country,
prefacing our description by observing that when Genseric
and the Vandals possessed Africa, there occurred to them
a destructive idea worthy of barbarians; for they imagined
that they would be better off if all the towns in this
country had no walls, so that the Romans might not
occupy any of them to their disadvantage. They accordingly
at once pulled down all the walls to their very foundation;
for all barbarians, as a rule, most quickly devise
and most promptly execute any plans which they form for
the injury of the Romans. The walls of Carthage and
some few other places alone were left, which they did not
care to keep in repair, but allowed to be ruined by age.
However, the Emperor Justinian, against the advice of all
men, who shrank in terror from the enterprise, and only
led on and assisted by God, sent Belisarius with an army
to Libya, took Gelimer, and destroyed the power of the
Vandals, killing many of them and making the rest prisoners
of war, as I have recounted in my ‘History of the
Wars.’ He rebuilt all the ruined fortifications in Libya,
and himself built many new ones.</p>

<p>First of all, he gave his attention to Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162"> 162</span>
now, as is right, is named Justiniana. He rebuilt the
whole of its ruined walls, and dug a trench encircling it,
which did not previously exist; he also built churches,
one dedicated to the Virgin, which is in the palace, and
one outside the palace dedicated to St. Prima, one of the
local saints. He built porticos on both sides of what is
called the Maritime market-place, and a noble public bath,
which he named the Baths of Theodora, after the name of
the Empress. He also built a monastery on the sea-shore
within the walls, close to the harbour, named Mandracium,
which he enclosed with a strong wall and formed into an
impregnable fort.</p>

<p>These were the works of Justinian at New Carthage.
In the country near it, which is called the Proconsulate,
there was an unwalled city named Baga,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> which was liable
to be taken by barbarians, not only if they marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163"> 163</span>
especially to attack it, but even if they passed near it.
This place the Emperor Justinian enclosed with a strong
wall, thus raising it to the rank of a city, and one, too,
which was capable of affording security to its citizens,
who, having met with such favour, named the city Theodorias,
in honour of the Empress. He also built a fort in
this country, named Tucca.</p>

<p>VI. In Byzacium is a city by the sea side, named
Adrumetus,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which in ancient times was great and populous,
so that it had the name and repute of being the chief
city in this country, because it was the first in size and in
prosperity. The Vandals demolished the walls of this
city, that the Romans might not be able, to hold it against
them, so that it was exposed to the attacks of the Moors,
who ravage that country; however, the Libyan inhabitants
provided for their own safety as far as they were able, by
piling up the ruins of their walls and joining their houses
to one another, by which means they were able to offer a
precarious resistance to their assailants. Their safety,
however, hung by a thread, and was very uncertain, as
they were at war with the Moors and neglected by the
Vandals. When, however, the Emperor Justinian, in the
course of the war, became master of Libya, he built a
wall of considerable size round this city, established in it
a sufficient garrison of soldiers, and enabled the inhabitants
to be confident of safety and to disregard all their
foes. For this reason they call it Justiniana to the present
day, thus repaying their debt of gratitude to the Emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164"> 164</span>
and showing their loyalty towards him by the adoption of
his name, for they had no other means of repaying the
kindness of the Emperor, as he wished for no other return
than this. On the shore of Byzacium there is another
place named Caputvada<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> by its inhabitants. It was at
this place that the Emperor’s army first landed when it
proceeded against Gelimer and the Vandals. Here, also,
that marvellous and ineffable gift was bestowed by God
upon the Emperor, which I have described in my ‘History
of the Wars.’ The country being altogether waterless, the
Roman army suffered greatly from thirst, whereupon the
earth, which formerly had always been dry, sent forth a
fountain at the place where the soldiers had formed their
camp. For when they dug, the water burst forth, and the
land, divesting itself of its natural barrenness, changed its
nature and became moist with sweet water. Here, therefore,
they encamped and passed the night, and marching
forth in battle array the next day, to cut the matter short,
gained possession of Libya. The Emperor Justinian
therefore, in order to erect a perpetual memorial of this
gift of God, who when He pleases can make the most
difficult things easy, at once determined to form this place
into a city, with a strong wall, and adorned with everything
else worthy of a city. The Emperor’s wish was
fulfilled. The wall and city were built, and the fortunes
of this open field were suddenly altered. The rustics,
throwing away the plough, dwell as citizens, and no longer
live a country, but a town life; for they meet together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165"> 165</span>
there daily, deliberate upon their own affairs, buy and
sell in the market with one another, and perform all the
other functions which distinguish the inhabitants of a
city.</p>

<p>These were his works on the seashore of Byzacium. In
the interior, on the frontier which borders on the barbarian
Moors, very strong fortresses are built to hold them in
check, in consequence of which they are no longer able to
overrun the empire, for he enclosed each of the cities
upon that frontier, which are named Mamma, Telepta, and
Cululius, with very strong walls, built a fort which the inhabitants
name Aumetera, and established in them trustworthy
garrisons of soldiers.</p>

<p>VII. In the same manner he ensured the safety of the
country of Numidia by fortifications and garrisons of
soldiers. I shall now enumerate each of these in detail.
There is a mountain in Numidia called Aurasius,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> the
like of which does not exist anywhere else in the world.
In the first place, it is lofty and precipitous, and extends
for a distance of about three days’ journey; it is also inaccessible,
all the ascents to it being barred by precipices.
When, however, one has reached the top, the ground is a
rich soil, smooth, and with easy roads, fair pastures, parks
planted with trees and all kinds of herbs. Fountains spring
out from the crags; there are quiet pools, rushing rivers with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166"> 166</span>
masses of broken water, and, what is strangest of all, the
crops and fruit-trees on this mountain produce twice as
much as any other part of Libya. Such is the mountain of
Aurasium, which was originally held by the Vandals,
whom the Moors dispossessed, and dwelt there until the
Emperor Justinian drove them out and annexed it to the
Roman Empire. To prevent the barbarians returning
thither and doing mischief, he fortified the cities in the
neighbourhood of this mountain, which he found deserted
and without walls; and having, besides them, built two
forts, and established there a sufficient garrison of soldiers,
he left the barbarians of that country no hope of making
a successful attack upon Aurasius. He also built impregnable
fortifications in the remainder of Numidia.
These were his works in this country.</p>

<p>There is a city in the island of Sardo, which is now
called Sardinia, which the Romans call the Fort of
Trajan; this Justinian enclosed with a wall, which it did
not formerly possess.</p>

<p>Near Gades, by one of the pillars of Hercules, on the
right hand, on the shore of Libya, was once a fort named
Septon,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> which had been built by the Romans in ancient
times, but had been neglected by the Vandals and had
perished through age. This place our Emperor Justinian
made strong by a wall and a garrison. In it also he built
a noble church dedicated to the Virgin, thus dedicating to
her the beginning of the empire, and rendering this fort
impregnable to all mankind in that quarter.</p>

<p>So much for this. No one can any longer doubt, but it
is now clear to all mankind that the Emperor Justinian
strengthened the empire, not only with fortifications, but
also with garrisons, from the eastern frontier to the setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167"> 167</span>
sun, which are the limits of the Roman dominion. Such
of the buildings of Justinian as I have been able to discover,
either by having seen them myself, or by hearing
them described by those who have seen them, I have as
far as I am able described in this work; but I am well
aware that I have omitted to speak of many others, which
have either escaped my notice by their great number or
remain altogether unknown to me; so that anyone who
turns his attention to searching them all out and describing
them in a book will have the advantage of having
performed a useful work, and will gain for himself the
reputation of a man of taste.</p>

<p>Procopius’s description of Justinian’s work at Constantinople
is so full and detailed that it would appear to be
complete. But it omits one church built by the Emperor,
viz., that of the Saviour, to which was attached the
Monastery of the Chora, now known as the Mosque
Kahireh, or Kahriyeh.</p>

<p>The history of this church is thus given in Ducange:</p>

<p>‘Chora seu Χώρα monasterium ita appellatum, condiderat
Justinianus et cum præ vetustate concidisset aliud
a fundamentis extruxit Alexii Imperatoris socrus Andronici
Ducæ conjux.</p>

<p>‘Denique cum ruinam rursum minaretur, illud reædificavit
Theodorus Metochita Magnus Logotheta, imperante
Andronico Palæologo Seniore.</p>

<p>‘Hæc omnia sic narrat Nicephorus Gregoras, lib. ix.:
“Divertit e regione et in vicinia (domus suæ) in sacro
scilicet Choræ Monasterio, quod ipse magnis ante sumptibus
vetustate ruinosum instauravat. Exstructum enim
olim fuerat a Justiniano Imperatore forma oblonga: deinde
cum vetustate usque ad ima concidisset, aliud a fundamentis
templum, ea qua nunc forma cernitur, Alexii Comneni
Imperatoris socrus condidit sed cum rursus ruinam
minitaretur, hic medio templo excepto, omnia liberali
manu pene instauravit. Metochitam hujus monasterii
instauratorem rursus prædicat, lib. viii.”’—Ducange, iv.,
p. 126.</p>

<p>An inscription over the south door of the church states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169"> 169</span>
that the monastery was outside the walls of Constantine;
that the church was rebuilt by Justinian; again, from its
foundations, in the time of Alexis Komnenos; and again
rebuilt by Theodore the Metochite.</p>

  <div class="caption">SKETCH PLAN</div>
</div>

<p>The well-known antiquary, Mons. Texier, describes it
thus in a detailed MS. account of ‘Constantinople,’
fol. <i>n. d.</i>, in the library of the R. Institute of Architects:</p>

<p>‘Kahrije, corruption du Grec της χωρας.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"> 170</span></p>

<p>‘Le premier fondateur de cette église fut Justinian;
et Theodore Metochite, grand chancelier des Autels
d’Andronice Paléologue n’en fut que le rénovateur. Le
cloître est souvent cité dans les auteurs Byzantines comme
lieu d’exil pour les religieux, et au dernier temps de l’empire
on conserva dans l’église le portrait célèbre de la Madone
qui avait été peint par St. Luke.’ A description of it is
also given in Salzenberg’s ‘Alt-Christliche Baudenkmale
von Constantinopel’ (Berlin, 1854), p. 36.</p>

<p>The latest account is given by the Rev. Charles G.
Curtis, in the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ 9th edition, <i>s.v.</i>
‘Constantinople:’</p>

<p>‘The monastery to which this church of the Saviour
belonged was Μονὴ τῆς χώρας, or, as we say, “in the
fields.” This was an ancient establishment, and its
church, the oldest church in the city, dates from the
third century.</p>

<p>‘A gem of beauty still, even in its decay, rich with
mosaic of the fourteenth century, of a style purer and more
refined than that which is more often seen and admired
at Ravenna and Palermo. In this church alternately
with the Hodegetria was kept the Holy Robe of the
Virgin, which was wont to be carried in procession when
the walls were threatened.’ The sketch-plan engraved
was made by T. H. L. in 1884. An elevation of the
exterior is given in C. Daly’s ‘Revue’ (1840), p. 13. (L.)</p>

<p>Church of the Virgin, Jerusalem:</p>

<p>The description by Procopius of this church is very
detailed; but the great alterations and destruction of
buildings throughout the Harem area since his time make
it extremely difficult to arrive at a correct understanding
of his account, or to identify any portion of the church
with existing buildings. It is usually supposed to have
occupied the site of the present Mosque El Aksa, the
entrances to which the Duc de Vogüé believes to be
remains of Justinian’s church.</p>

<p>The questions as to the church are involved, to a considerable
extent, with those relating to the date and
authorship of the Dome of the Rock, which has usually
been assigned to the Caleph Abd-el-Melek; but the late
Mr. Fergusson, whose great architectural knowledge is
undisputed, maintained that it was no other than Constantine’s
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and that the
church described by Procopius was not on the site of
El Aksa, but at the eastern angle of the temple area, and
now utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>The subject, already sufficiently complicated, has been
rendered still more so by a theory brought forward in
1882, by the well-known Professor Sepp, to the effect that
the Dome of the Rock was not constructed by Constantine
nor by Abd-el-Melek, but by Justinian.</p>

<p>The question is much more difficult to decide than may
at first sight appear; and I confess that after having, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172"> 172</span>
some years past, carefully collected the various documents
on the subject, including the valuable translations
published by my friend the late Professor Palmer, of Arabic
historians, and having subsequently visited Jerusalem and
studied the subject on the spot, with the kind assistance
of Dr. Chaplin and others, I find that there are so many
points to be cleared up, that I should not like to offer
a definite opinion on the several disputed points until
after another visit, which I hope to make shortly, to Jerusalem.
My present views, so far as I may venture to
put them forward, are in accordance with those of De
Vogüé, Sir C. Warren and Captain Conder, viz., that the
Dome of the Rock was built by Abd-el-Melek. (L.)</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> ‘A new era for Christian architecture commenced with his reign.
The historian Procopius has simplified, in the different provinces of
his Eastern empire, the task to those who would search for vestiges of
buildings erected by this Prince. Anthemius was selected by him as
his architect, and the Church of St. Sophia became the type of all the
Greek churches from the sixth century. The basilica was, until his
time, the type of the Christian church. Anthemius abandoned this
form. The chief feature of the church was the dome, the form of the
oblong nave being abandoned.’—Texier and Pullan, ‘Byzantine Architecture’
(fol., London, 1864), p. 20. (L.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> There is a pun in the original upon παιδιά and παιδέια. Cf. Gibbon,
ch. xl. (S.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> ‘Taken altogether, there is no building erected during the first
thirteen centuries after the Christian era which, as an interior, is either
so beautiful or so worthy of attentive study as this.’—Fergusson,
‘Handbook of Architecture’ (8vo., London, 1855), p. 951. (L.)</p>

<p>In addition to Procopius, the erection of St. Sophia has been described
by Agathias, and at much greater length by Paulus Silentiarius,
and the three descriptions have been compared and analyzed in the
‘Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ,’ <i>s.v.</i> Paulus Silentiarius. (L.)</p>

<p>A full description of St. Sophia with plans, sections, and detailed
drawings of the mosaics, sculpture, etc., is given by Salzenburg in his
splendid work ‘Alt Christliche von Constantinopel’ (Berlin, 1854). (L.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> ‘The solid piles which sustained the cupola were composed of
huge blocks of freestone, hewn into squares and triangles, fortified by
circles of iron, and firmly cemented by the infusion of lead and quicklime.’—Gibbon,
ch. xl. (S.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> ‘Nine western doors open into the vestibule, and from thence
into the <i>narthex</i> or exterior portico. That portico was the humble
station of the penitents. The nave, or body of the church, was
filled by the congregation of the faithful; but the two sexes were
prudently distinguished, and the upper and lower galleries were
allotted for the more private devotion of the women.’—Gibbon,
ch. xl. (S.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Λώρους. I am unacquainted with the precise meaning of this
word. Ducange, in his ‘Glossary,’ describes ΛΩΡΟΣ as ‘Fornix,’
‘arcus,’ Ἁψίς, quoting Procopius. But this gives no definite information;
nor, after consulting with several well-known authorities on this
subject, can I find that the application of the term is now known. It
is not alluded to either in Britton’s ‘Dictionary,’ or Willis’s ‘Nomenclature
of the Middle Ages.’ From the context and Ducange’s use of
the word ἅψις, I presume that λῶρος is applied to the great arch forming
the opening of an apse. (L.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> ‘St. Irene templum a Constantino M. extructum—tres sacras ædes.
Deiparæ scilicet, St. Theodori et St. Irenes, eidem magnæ ecclesiæ
unitas fuisse, neque proprium clerum habuisse, qui in iis sacra

intra ejusdem septa ædificata dicitur.’ ‘Denique concussa est ipsa
ædes eo terræ motu qui accidit Leone Isauro regnante. Hodie intra
septum regium includi.’—Ducange, ‘Byzantinæ Historiæ Scriptoribus
Constantinopolis Christiana’ (Venice, fol., 1729), lib. iv., p. 102.</p>

<p>Rebuilt, in part at all events, by Justinian late in his reign, but in a
style entirely different from that of St. Sophia or SS. Sergius and
Bacchus, being oblong on plan, with aisles and an apse at the east
end. This apse was cleared in 1881. Mr. Edwin Freshfield, who
visited the church at that time, states that he ‘found that it was filled
with marble benches, or steps, somewhat similar to the Church of
Torcello, near Venice. There is no doubt that they formed part of
the original arrangement of the church, and that this was due to its
being the Patriarchal church.’—<i>Athenæum</i>, 15th August, 1885. (L.)</p>

<p>One of the most interesting buildings in Constantinople. It is
rightly called the Little Agia Sofia, as it was the first essay of Justinian,
before he became Emperor, in the style of which the Great Church
was to be the glory. I make no doubt that Anthemius of Tralles was
the architect, and the building has in it many of the peculiarities of
the Church Agia Sofia. It is further interesting as having furnished
the model for the Church of St. Vitale at Ravenna, some of the details
in the latter church being also copied from the Kutchuk Agia Sofia.
This church was dedicated to SS. Sergius and Bacchus.—Mr. Edwin

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> ‘The fortifications of Dara,’ says Gibbon, ‘may represent the
military architecture of the age. The city was surrounded by two
walls, and the interval between them, of fifty paces, afforded a retreat
to the cattle of the besieged. The inner wall was a monument of
strength and beauty: it measured sixty feet from the ground, and the
height of the towers was one hundred feet; the loopholes, from whence
an enemy might be annoyed with missile weapons, were small, but
numerous; the soldiers were placed along the rampart, under the
shelter of double galleries, and a third platform, spacious and secure,
was raised on the summit of the towers. The exterior wall seems to
have been less lofty, but more solid; and each tower was protected by
a quadrangular bulwark. A hard rocky soil resisted the tools of the
miners, and on the south-east, where the ground was more tractable,
their approach was retarded by a new work, which advanced in the
shape of a half-moon. The double and treble ditches were filled
with a stream of water; and in the management of the river, the
most skilful labour was employed to supply the inhabitants, to distress
the besiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or artificial
inundation.’—Gibbon, ch. xl. (S.) See Note, page 58.</p>

C’est le τεῖχος, le mur ou la courtine, sur la face de laquelle s’élèvent
les tours; en avant de ce mur s’élève le mur du parapet, première
defense de la courtine, προτείχισμα. Ce mur est espacé (du τεῖχος) de
la courtine d’un quart environ de la hauteur totale. L’espace compris
entre ces deux murs est le péribole (περίβολος), le chemin couvert. Ce
mot est appliqué aussi au chemin interieur de l’agger qui longe le
fossé (τάφρος). L’agger, qui se compose des terres du fossé, est soutenu
par un mur, quelquefois flanqué de tours, qui est le ἀντιτείχισμα, mur
de l’avant rempart. Les tours (πύργοι), sont appliquées a l’une et

réunis par un mur dans la partie supérieure, et forment des espèces

left standing in Palestine.</p>

<p>The atrium is destroyed, but the basilica, consisting of a nave and
four aisles, is almost intact, the original columns and the clerestory
walls, with fragments of glass mosaic (of twelfth century), remaining.
The basilica measures 87 feet east and west by 75 feet north and
south.</p>

<p>At the east end is a transept with north and south apses and an
east apse of equal size. The floor of the transept is raised for a width
equal to that of the basilica nave (35 feet). The basilica is separated
by a wall, erected by the Greeks in 1842, from the transept.—‘Palestine

<p>Notwithstanding the slight notice of this city taken by Procopius,
the part taken by Justinian in its adornment is otherwise spoken of in
a very striking manner, and its celebrated basilica, usually stated, as
above, to have been the work of Constantine, has been assigned in
part to Justinian. The eastern part is almost certainly later than
Constantine.</p>

he renovated—Eutychius says rebuilt—the church.’—Fergusson’s

<p>Eutychius’ account is thus:</p>

<p>‘Jussit etiam Imperator legatum Ecclesiam Bethleemiticam quæ
parva fuit diruere, aliamq, amplam, magnam et pulchram fabricare,
adeo ut non esset Hierosolymis templum ipsâ pulchrius.</p>

<p>‘Perveniens ergo Legatus Hierosolyma, Nosocomium peregrinis
condidit, et Ecclesiam Elenæ perfecit, templaque quæ incenderant
Samaritani instauravit, nec non Monasteria quam plurima extruxit,
dirutâque Ecclesiâ Bethleemiticâ eaudem eo quo jam se habet modo
ædificavit.</p>

<p>‘Cumque his omnibus absolutis ad Imperatorem reversus esset, ille,
describe mihi (inquit) quomodo Ecclesiam Bethleemiticam extruxisti.
Quam cum ipsi descripsisset, haud probavit Imperator descriptionem
estam nec ullatinus ipsi placuit, quaré valde ipsi iratus. Acceptos (inquit)
nummos tibi ipsi congessisti, ædificium autem extruxisti male compactum
et Ecclesiam tenebrosam confecisti nullatenus ex mente mea fabricatam,
nec consilium meum secutus es. Capiteque ipsum plecti jussit.’</p>

<p>Eutychius adds after Omar’s conquest:</p>

<p>‘Deinde Bethleem ad eam visendam prefectus cum adesset orationis
tempus intra Ecclesiam oravit ad arcum Australem.</p>

<p>‘Erat autem arcus totus opere tessellate variegatus. Scripsitque

the work. A long account of the city and its walls is given at p. 375,
etc. Also in Smith and Porcher’s ‘Discoveries at Cyrene’ (1864),
p. 64, where Justinian’s walls are particularly mentioned.</p>

placed the gardens of the Hesperides—now Ben Ghazi. (Beechey,
p. 314.) Bengazi may be considered as occupying the site of the Berenice
of the Ptolemies and of the Hesperis of earlier times; but very few
remains now appear above ground to interest the sculptor, the architect
or the antiquary.—J. Pennell’s ‘Herodotus’ (4to., London, 1800),
p. 154.</p>

<p>Of the ancient city very few remains are now visible. ‘At the back
of the castle, some foundations may be seen cropping out, but the
tomb of a saint prevents any excavations being made.’—Smith and
Porcher’s ‘Discoveries at Cyrene’ (1864), p. 13.</p>

<p>‘Bengazi, the ancient Berenice, built by Ptolemy Philadelphus.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains but its port, which is certainly the best on the
coast of Tripoli.’ ‘On the north there are still to be seen, beyond seamark,
the foundations of several large buildings, of stones 8 or 10 feet
long and 3 broad, which, by their own weight and being bound by
strong cement, have preserved their places.’—Lieut.-Col. Playfair,
‘Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce’ (4to., London, 1877.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> Ptolemaïs (Ptolemeta), now Dolmeita. V. Beechey, p. 376. He
gives, at p. 338, etc., a plan of the city and environs, and also drawings
of some of the ruins. The city was something less than a mile
in length from north to south, and its breadth from east to west
something more than three-quarters. Captain Beechey describes the
remains of the walls to the city and harbour, of two theatres, an amphitheatre,
and various buildings of more than ordinary consequence.
‘Some of the shafts of small columns are spiral and formed of
coloured marbles, and may probably be attributed to the time of
Justinian, when the city revived under his politic munificence.’</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Playfair, ‘Footsteps of Bruce’ (1877), pp. 288, 289, gives
a good account also.</p>

<p>Smith and Porcher, pp. 64, 66, give drawings of ruins. ‘At a point
nearly opposite the centre of the east wall, the ravine is spanned by
the arch of a bridge still standing, which appears to have been built
for an aqueduct which we could trace distinctly for some distance
from the city. Within the walls the aqueduct led in the direction of
enormous reservoirs near the centre of the city.’ Messrs. Smith and
Porcher describe them as consisting of six chambers, each chamber
too feet long and 20 broad, arched over. The repairs to the aqueduct
and cisterns are ascribed by Procopius to Justinian. (L.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> Leptis Magna. ‘The city appears to have been comprehended
within little more than a square half-mile of ground. The actual
remains are still sufficient to be somewhat imposing; but they are for
the most part so deeply buried under the sand which ten centuries of
neglect have allowed to accumulate over them, that plans of them
could not be obtained without very extensive excavations. The style
of the buildings is universally Roman.’ The walls and fortifications,
probably restored by Justinian, were finally demolished by the Saracens.
From that time the city appears to have been wholly abandoned
and its remains employed in the construction of Modern Tripoli.—‘North
Coast of Africa,’ by Beechey (4to., London, 1828), pp.
52, 54.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Playfair, p. 283, describes the remains thus: ‘Libidah,
the ancient town of Leptis Magna, three days’ journey from Tripoli
where there are a great extent of ruins, but all in bad taste—chiefly
done in the lime of Aurelian—indeed very bad. It is said that in the
time of Louis XIV. seven monstrous columns of granite or marble
were carried from this place into France.’ Bruce also states that he
saw several statues of good taste which had been deprived of their
heads. (L.)</p>

of Africa.’—Shaw’s ‘Travels in Barbary,’ p. 113. (L.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> Carthage. Shaw, p. 81, etc., of his ‘Travels in Barbary,’ describes
the remains of Carthage existing in his time (<i>circa</i> 1750), in particular
the great cistern (of which he gives a plan at p. 75), ‘which had
very little suffered,’ and ‘the famous aqueduct, a great part whereof
is still standing:’—‘We see—a long range of its arches, all of them
intact, 70 feet high, supported by columns 16 feet square ... the
channel being high and broad enough for an ordinary person to
walk in.’</p>

<p>Bruce says, ‘We passed ancient Carthage, of which little remains
but the cisterns, the aqueduct, and a magnificent flight of steps leading
up to the Temple of Esculapius.’ He gives (p. 130) a drawing of the
aqueduct, which Col. Playfair describes ‘as one of the greatest works
the Romans ever executed in North Africa.’ ‘It was destroyed by
the Vandals, restored by Belisarius, the general of Justinian. On the
expulsion of the Byzantines it was once more cut off, restored by the
Arabs, again destroyed by the Spaniards, and finally restored by the
present Bey, Sidi Saduk, at a cost of 13,000,000 francs.’—Lieut.-Col.

Pliny, the ΒΑΓΑ of Plutarch, and the Vaccensium ordo Splendissimus,

character that Sallust gives his Vacca of being a town of great trade.’
‘The walls are raised out of the ancient materials.’—Shaw’s ‘Travels
in Barbary,’ p. 92.</p>

<p>‘The ancient city was surrounded by a wall, flanked by square
towers—no doubt this was originally constructed by the Byzantines—but
were allowed by the Arabs to fall into decay. The only part in a
relative state of preservation is the Kasba, a great part of which seems
to me the original construction of Belisarius or Solomon.’ It contains
‘a large and lofty hall, about 15 paces long and 10 wide, with a
vaulted roof supported on two square pillars.’—Lieut.-Col. Playfair,
p. 234. (L.)</p>
